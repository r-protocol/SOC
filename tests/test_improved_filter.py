Determine if this article is relevant for security professionals and threat intelligence.

‚úÖ ALWAYS RELEVANT - Mark as YES:
- Ransomware, malware, trojans, backdoors, infostealers, rootkits, botnets
- Vulnerabilities (CVE-####, exploits, zero-days, patches, security flaws)
- Threat actors (APT groups, nation-state hackers, cybercrime groups)
- Security incidents (breaches, attacks, compromises, hacks, intrusions)
- Attack techniques (phishing, DDoS, supply chain, social engineering, LOLBAS/Living-off-the-Land)
- Authentication attacks (NTLM, LDAP, credential theft, privilege escalation)
- Security products & vendor research (CrowdStrike, Falcon, Microsoft Defender, Sophos, etc.)
- Threat intelligence reports (eCrime landscape, APJ reports, threat analysis)
- Security features & protections (EDR, XDR, exposure management, automated response)
- Incident response & forensics (SOC operations, threat hunting, DFIR)
- Security advisories (CISA, vendor bulletins, end of support warnings)

‚ùå NOT RELEVANT - Mark as NO:
- Shopping deals, gift guides, product reviews (phones, TVs, gadgets)
- General tech news (earnings, stock prices, mergers) UNLESS security-related
- Entertainment (movies, games, streaming)
- Lifestyle (travel, food, fashion)
- General productivity software features UNLESS security-related

üîë KEY RULE: If title contains these words, it's ALWAYS YES:

phishing, authentication, NTLM, LDAP, credential, firewall, EDR, XDR, SOC, 
CrowdStrike, Falcon, privilege escalation, living-off-the-land, LOLBAS, eCrime

üîë VENDOR SECURITY CONTENT = YES:
Any article from security vendors (CrowdStrike, Sophos, Microsoft Security, etc.) 
discussing threats, attacks, defenses, or security features is RELEVANT.
