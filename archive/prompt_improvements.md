# Prompt Strengthening Summary

## Changes Made to `analysis.py`

### 1. **Enhanced Risk Level Definitions**
- Added detailed criteria that must ALL be met for HIGH classification
- Made it explicit that HIGH requires active exploitation + widespread impact
- Emphasized conservative classification approach

### 2. **Comprehensive Examples**
Added specific examples for each risk level:
- **HIGH**: Active WSUS exploitation, widespread ransomware campaigns
- **MEDIUM**: Patched vulnerabilities, targeted sector attacks
- **LOW**: Failed hacks, theoretical attacks, niche software bugs
- **INFORMATIONAL**: Conferences (Pwn2Own), newsletters, vendor announcements

### 3. **Explicit Exclusion List**
Added "DO NOT CLASSIFY AS HIGH" section with clear ❌ markers:
- Conference demonstrations → INFORMATIONAL
- Newsletter roundups → INFORMATIONAL
- Podcast episodes → INFORMATIONAL
- Vendor announcements → INFORMATIONAL
- Awards/certifications → INFORMATIONAL

### 4. **Special Newsletter Rule**
Added critical rule specifically for newsletters:
- Titles containing "newsletter", "roundup", "round", "digest", "Stormcast" → INFORMATIONAL

### 5. **Step-by-Step Classification Process**
Added structured approach:
- **Step 1**: Check title for INFORMATIONAL keywords first
- **Step 2**: Only then assess actual threat level
- Prevents content-based over-classification

### 6. **Expected Distribution Guidance**
Explicitly stated expected weekly distribution:
- INFORMATIONAL: 30-40%
- LOW: 20-30%
- MEDIUM: 25-35%
- HIGH: 5-15%

### 7. **Temperature Reduction**
- Changed from 0.3 to 0.1 for more deterministic, conservative outputs
- Reduced top_p from 0.9 to 0.85

## Test Results

### Before Changes:
- "Hackers earn $1M at Pwn2Own" → **HIGH** ❌
- "SECURITY AFFAIRS NEWSLETTER ROUND 68" → **MEDIUM** ❌

### After Changes:
- "Hackers earn $1M at Pwn2Own" → **INFORMATIONAL** ✅
- "SECURITY AFFAIRS NEWSLETTER ROUND 68" → **INFORMATIONAL** ✅

## Expected Impact

With these changes, you should see:
1. **More INFORMATIONAL articles**: Conference coverage, newsletters, vendor posts
2. **More LOW articles**: Minor bugs, theoretical attacks, failed exploits
3. **Fewer HIGH articles**: Only truly critical active threats
4. **Better balanced distribution** matching the 30-40% / 20-30% / 25-35% / 5-15% targets

## Next Steps

To see the improved classification in action:
1. Run `main.py` again with new articles
2. Monitor the risk distribution in the output
3. Check if LOW and INFORMATIONAL quotas are being met

The strengthened prompt should now correctly identify educational content, conference results, and aggregated news as INFORMATIONAL rather than inflating their threat levels.
